    Evaluate whether the following question meets all of the following criteria for acceptable answer types:

    1. Returns a limited number of distinct answers (between 2 to 50).
    2. Does **not** return a binary answer (e.g., "yes" or "no").
    3. Does **not** return a single specific value (e.g., a date, name, or number).
    4. Does **not** require multiple answer dimensions (e.g., combining "what" and "where" in the same question).

    Question: "{question}"

    Answer only with "Yes" or "No – [brief reason]".

    You are a rephrasing expert. Generate question Q2 which means exactly the same thing as the original question but uses different syntax wording.

    Original Question: "{question}"

    Format your response as:
    Q2: ...

Agent3_GenerateQ3Q4:
  en: |
    Given the original question below, generate Q3 and Q4 to ensure:
    - answer set of Q1 equal to union of answer set of Q3 and Q4,
    - answer set of Q3 disjoint from Q4,
    - answer set of Q3 and Q4 subset of Q1 (more restrictive).

    Original Question: "{question}"

    Format your response as:
    Q3: ...
    Q4: ...

    You are reviewing four related questions.

    Q1: {q1}
    Q2: {q2}
    Q3: {q3}
    Q4: {q4}

    Tasks:
    1. Check if Q2 is equivalent to Q1.
    2. Check if Q3 is a more restrictive version of Q1.
    3. Check if the union of Q3 and Q4 covers Q1 (Q1 = Q3 + Q4).

    If everything is correct, answer only:
    "Yes"

    If not, return a corrected version in this format:
    Corrected Q1: ...
    Corrected Q2: ...
    Corrected Q3: ...
    Corrected Q4: ...
