        "I'm just an AI, I don't have access to a search engine or internet. However, I can guide you on how to find this information.\n\nYou can use Wikidata's query service to retrieve the necessary data. Unfortunately, I'm not able to perform queries or fetch data from external sources.\n\nHowever, based on your instructions, I can provide some general guidance:\n\n1. You can visit https://query.wikidata.org/ and create a new query.\n2. You'll need to define the entity you want to query (in this case, Francis Daniel Crean).\n3. Use SPARQL syntax or Wikidata's query builder to define your query.\n\nHere is an example of how you could start constructing your query:\n\n```sparql\nSELECT ?item\nWHERE {\n  ?item wdt:P26 \"Francis Daniel Crean\"@en.\n  ?item wdt:P40 ?deathDate.\n  BIND(YEAR(?deathDate) < 2024 AS ?condition)\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example and might need to be adjusted based on your specific needs. Also, keep in mind that you'll need some knowledge of SPARQL syntax and Wikidata's query service.\n\nIf you're not familiar with SPARQL or Wikidata queries, I recommend checking out their documentation: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL\n\nOnce you run the query, you can retrieve the list of sons who died before December 31st, 2024. If no results are found, it will likely return an empty result set.\n\nSince I don't have direct access to Wikidata's query service or external sources, I cannot provide a definitive answer for you. However, I hope this guidance helps you in finding the information you're looking for!"
