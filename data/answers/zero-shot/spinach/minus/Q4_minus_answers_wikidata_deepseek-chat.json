        "To answer your question, I would need to query Wikidata for artists born on the same date (but different year) as Rachel Stevens (born April 9, 1978). However, since I don't have direct access to live Wikidata queries, I can't fetch this data in real-time.  \n\nHere’s how you can find the answer yourself:  \n1. Go to [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and search for **Rachel Stevens (Q230934)**.  \n2. Check her date of birth (**April 9, 1978**).  \n3. Run a query (using the Wikidata Query Service) to find other artists with the same birth date but different years.  \n\nIf you'd like, I can help construct a SPARQL query for this. Otherwise, since I can't retrieve live data, the answer is:  \n\n**no answer**"
