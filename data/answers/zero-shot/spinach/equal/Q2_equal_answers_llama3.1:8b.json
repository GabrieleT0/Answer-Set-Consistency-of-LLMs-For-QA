        "Here is the list of monarchs married to someone from Germany:\n\nPhilip II of England married Mary Tudor's first cousin, Margaret of Austria, a princess from the Habsburg family in what is now modern-day Germany.\n\nMary I of England was not married to anyone from Germany, but Philip II of Spain was King of England and Ireland as the husband of Mary I. Philip II of Spain had German ancestry through his mother Juana of Castile who was the daughter of Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and therefore a German prince.\n\n Elizabeth I of England never married, so this is not relevant.\n\nAnne of Great Britain married Prince George of Denmark and Norway. Prince George of Denmark and Norway was born in Copenhagen, Denmark to Frederick IV, King of Denmark and Norway's sister-in-law, Princess Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg who was a German princess by birth.\n\nGeorge I of Great Britain married Sophia Dorothea of Celle.

Her family, the Wittelsbachs had lands and castles on the borders with modern day Switzerland and France but she was from Heidelberg Castle and therefore German.\n\nChristian V of Denmark-Norway married Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel who was a German princess by birth.\n\nChristian VI of Denmark-Norway married Sophia Magdalena of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, however her father Frederick William I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth died in 1735 before the marriage. Her brother George William, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth was a German prince.\n\nFrederick I of Württemberg married Augusta Caroline of Stolberg-Gedern who was born in 1757 and later became Frederick I's wife after his first wife died from tuberculosis. She was the daughter of Leopold, Count Palatine of Gleichenthal and Christina, Countess Palatine of Salm-Kyrburg who were German princes.\n\nElizabeth Alexandra Mary Mountbatten Windsor married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (born in Corfu, Greece) but he had been raised by his grandparents on the Greek island of Crete. He later moved to England with his parents and became a naturalized British citizen but was born in Germany to Prince Andrew of Battenberg who was a German prince and Princess Alice of Hesse and by Rhine's family, the House of Hesse-Darmstadt were a German royal house.\n\nGeorge III of the United Kingdom married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She was the daughter of Charles Louis Frederick, Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Elisabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen who were German princes.\n\nPrince George, Duke of Cambridge married Sarah Spencer. Sarah's father was Edward John Spencer 8th Earl Spencer but through her mother she had a maternal connection to the Kingdom of Prussia where the royal family was known as the House of Hohenzollern. They were German kings from 1701 to 1918.\n\nPrince Andrew, Duke of York married Sarah Margaret Ferguson who is a commoner with no direct connection to Germany but through her second husband's ancestry she has a connection to Denmark and Norway which both have shared history with modern-day Germany.\n\nEdward VII of the United Kingdom married Alexandra of Denmark. She was born in Copenhagen, Denmark to Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel who were both German princes.\n\nGeorge IV of the United Kingdom never married but had children out of wedlock.\n\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (married to Elizabeth II) was born in Corfu, Greece and was raised by his grandparents.

His mother was a German princess from the House of Battenberg which were a German royal house but also intermarried with other European families including British and Greek royalty.\n\nAlbert, Prince Consort never married but his wife Queen Victoria of United Kingdom's husband married her at the age of 20 to Albert who was born in Schleswig (now part of modern-day Denmark) or possibly Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg depending on how one interprets \"Schlesien\" - however he did have a connection to Germany through his mother Augusta Caroline of Nassau-Weilburg.\n\nGeorge I of the United Kingdom's wife Sophia Dorothea of Celle was a German princess born in Hanover, which is part of modern-day Germany.\n\nPrince Edward, Earl of Wessex married Sophie Rhys-Jones who does not have a direct connection to Germany but has ancestry from other European royal families that intermarried with German royalty including the Hohenzollerns and the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, both German royal houses.\n\nCharles III was born in England but his wife Diana, Princess of Wales had some maternal connection to Denmark-Norway which shares a history with modern-day Germany."
