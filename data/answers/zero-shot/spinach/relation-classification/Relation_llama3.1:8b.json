To determine the relationship between q1 and q3, we must examine their answer sets independently. \n\nHowever, considering q1, q2, and q3 together reveals that all three questions pertain to monarchs of the United Kingdom married to German spouses or individuals of German origin. Therefore, examining the individual relationships between each pair of questions will provide a comprehensive understanding of how these concepts relate.\n\nComparing s1 (the set of answers for q1 that are not answers for q2) and s2 (the set of answers for q3), we note that both sets include monarchs married to German spouses, but the specifics of their marital relationships differ. Since q2 specifically asks about princesses, its answer set would be a subset of q1's, whereas q3's scope is broader.\n\nTherefore, the relation between s1 and s2 can be classified as Overlap because they share common elements (monarchs married to German spouses), but neither fully contains the other."
