I've heard of different kinds before, but I can't remember if stepuis are even considered a real fish species. \n\nWait, perhaps \"tepuis\" is an archaic or less common word for something else. I'll try breaking it down. \"Tepuis\" sounds like \"teusies,\" which in old English was a coin. Maybe that's not it. Or maybe it's derived from another language? Not sure about the origin.\n\nI wonder if there are any notable species with that name. Let me think about other fish families or something. Oh, wait! I think \"tepuis\" might be a term used in some regions for a type of shellfish or crustacean. But do they really call them stepuis? I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's related to the French word \"toupies,\" which are also a type of fish. No, that doesn't seem right either. Perhaps I should consider if there are any scientific references or dictionaries that mention this term. If I recall correctly, it might be a less common or regional term rather than an official classification.\n\nGiven all these possibilities, I don't think \"tepuis\" is a recognized species in the international community. It's possible that the term was used in specific contexts where it referred to a type of fish found there, but without more context, I can't provide accurate information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, based on my current knowledge and lack of solid evidence, I think \"tepuis\" might not be an established category or species.

That's strange because most mathematicians do publish in various specialized journals. Perhaps he focuses on specific areas within algebraic combinatorics that are more prominent internationally?\n\nI should think about the fields of his research. Algebraic combinatorics is a broad area, so it could be published in journals like the Journal of Algebra or Combinatorica. I'm not certain if he has specifically listed these.\n\nAnother thought: maybe some universities or mathematical societies list his work. Perhaps the Indian National Mathematical Olympiad committee has resources? Or maybe he's on a platform where their papers are cited, but that might be too speculative.\n\nWait, if there's no information available, should I just say 'no answer'?

He was a Spanish painter famous for his vibrant and emotional work. I remember that he wrote \"El Mirador\" or \"The Mirror,\" which is one of the most iconic works from his style.\n\nNow, about where his art is shown. I think museums in Spain might be primary targets because El Greco was based there. The Louvre has a significant collection, but it's mostly French and British, so maybe they don't have much from Spain. There's also the Guggenheim Museum in New York City; I'm not sure if Spain is one of their target countries for Spanish art.\n\nAnother place to consider is the Prado in Madrid. The Prado is a major Spanish art museum, but again, I'm not certain about the specifics regarding El Greco.

Sometimes, international collections are curated to include artists from different countries, but I'm not sure about El Greco specifically.\n\nSince El Greco was born and raised in Spain, it's likely that his art is more prominently displayed at museums there. However, I also know some Spanish museums might have a smaller collection, so it's possible he works there but may be less famous compared to other artists.\n\nI should note that while these museums display El Greco's work, the extent of their presence and prominence might vary.

Maybe something like \"Lemonade\" or \"The Kids Are Back\"? I'm not exactly sure about all her hits, but I know \"Rise and Shine\" is one she was a part of.\n\nFor TV, I believe she was involved in \"American Idol.\" That seems familiar because she started that show when she was 10.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which astronauts from MIT completed degrees. Let's break this down step by step. First, I should consider who is typically associated with MIT. MIT is a prestigious institution known for its engineering and science programs.\n\nNow, thinking about astronauts at MIT, I recall that MIT has several notable alumni in the field of aerospace engineering. The Tsiung Lee Education Center is a significant hub, so that's a starting point. TSiung Lee is an astronaut who completed his B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees at MIT.\n\nLooking beyond just engineering, there might be others involved in other fields related to space exploration or defense. I know that engineers like Robert Kozar are associated with MIT, but he's not an astronaut himself. However, he worked on the Apollo program, which ties into a lot of MIT education.\n\nThere's also the concept of \"The Air Force Flight School\" at MIT, which might have astronauts who have done degrees there. But I'm not sure if they're considered astronauts in the traditional sense since they're likely involved in training rather than actively working on missions.\n\nOther fields like aerospace engineering definitely have MIT alumni. For example, Bill Gates was a recipient of a Ph.D. from MIT, but he's a well-known businessman and entrepreneur. His role as Chief Technology Officer at Google doesn't align with being an astronaut. However, I should note that his education is in computer science, not aerospace.\n\nI should also consider if there are any others who might be associated with MIT while working on space exploration projects. Maybe someone like Frank Zollman or others involved in the Apollo project? But those don't specifically have degrees from MIT unless they did their studies at MIT as well.\n\nWait, I remember that Bill Tilden is an astronaut and also has a Ph.D., but he's associated with the Air Force. So, not strictly MIT, though MIT does have TSiung Lee in aerospace engineering. Therefore, including him might be appropriate if we're listing MIT alumni who are astronauts.\n\nPutting it all together, the top ones seem to be Robert Kozar and Bill Tilden. I should list them out and make sure each has degrees from MIT or is part of their degree programs. That way, the answer covers both engineering-focused individuals and those involved in space exploration while having educational backgrounds.\n</think>\n\nRobert Kozar",

I'm pretty sure it's not the United States because they're in North America now, but the question is about Africa specifically. So maybe the first two or three places go to the US.\n\nI think the next biggest is probably South Africa. That makes sense because it's huge and a significant country. After that, maybe Kenya? I believe Kenya is large and has some big cities like Nairobi. Then comes Botswana, which I've heard of before as a large landlocked country.\n\nWait, are there any other countries beyond this? There might be Namibia and possibly Democratic Republic of the Congo. Let me see: Namibia's area is about 3.2 million square kilometers, and the Congo is around 5.0 million. But I'm not sure if they're on the top list or if they're included.\n\nLet me think again. The order might be: United States, South Africa, Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, Malawi, Mozambique, and then perhaps Lesotho? Or maybe it's slightly different.\n\nI'm not entirely certain about their exact areas, but I can recall that the US is first. Then comes South Africa with about 19 million square kilometers.

The Congo is much bigger at around 5.0 million.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if the Congo is in Africa or just South Asia. No, the Congo is a country, so it's definitely part of Africa. So that should be third. Then Uganda and Malawi both being about 4.8 million each? Or maybe slightly different numbers. Finally, Mozambique at around 2.5 million.\n\nPutting this all together, I think the top 10 would be:\n\n1. United States of America (US)\n2. South Africa\n3. Kenya\n4. Botswana\n5. Namibia\n6.

Then comes Uganda next, maybe? But I'm not entirely sure about the exact population figures. Wait, I think Nigeria has the biggest, but sometimes it can vary based on sources and years.\n\nUganda came to the top as an independent nation after independence, so that might mean it's one of the largest. Then there's Kenya, which I believe is the third. After that, Uganda would be fourth because of their population growth. \n\nThen moving down the list, the next country could be Zimbabwe or maybe Botswana? Wait, no, Botswana was a small island nation before independence and had very low populations. So maybe it's more likely to be an independent country. That might put it as number five.\n\nI'm trying to think if there are any other significant African countries beyond these ten. There's also the Democratic Republic of the Congo in South Africa, but I don't think that's considered a country anymore. Similarly, countries like Ghana or Nigeria, but those are already on the top list.\n\nSo compiling this, maybe the order is: Nigeria (1), Kenya (2), Uganda (3), Zimbabwe (4), and so on. Let me make sure about their populations because sometimes data can vary based on when it's measured and by source. \n\nNigeria has around 270 million people, right? Then Uganda around 38 million—so yes, number two. Kenya comes in at about 36 million, which makes it third. Zimbabwe was around 14 million in the early days but maybe now is around 9 or 10 million. The next one could be Namibia, with a population of under a million. \n\nWait, but I think Namibia might have started as an independent country and its population has been growing since that time. So perhaps the order after Zimbabwe is Namibia (5), followed by Lesotho (6) or possibly Burundi (7), and so on.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about all the exact numbers, but based on my general knowledge, these would be the top ten. If I were to list them out, they'd be Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Burundi, Congo (which is part of Republic of the Congo now but before that was independent), Democratic Republic of the Congo, and maybe Botswana if it's still considered a country.\n\nWait, no, because the Republic of the Congo after 1999 became a separate entity. So perhaps the next after Namibia would be the Republic of the Congo (which is technically part of West Africa) with around 2 million people. Then maybe the Republic of South Sudan, which was an independent country but now a republic of two states.\n\nI think I'm mixing up some countries, so I might need to double-check. Let me try to recall: after Namibia comes Lesotho in 1985, then Burundi in 2016, the Republic of the Congo (which became part of South Africa after 1999), which is around 2 million, followed by the Republic of the Congo as a separate entity since 2017. Then comes the Republic of the Democratic Republic of Congo (now a republic) in 2024. \n\nWait, but the Republic of the Congo was an independent country before South Africa. So after Lesotho, maybe it's the Republic of the Congo with population around 2 million, then the Republic of the Congo again as part of its territory. Then the Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (which is a republic in today's terms). \n\nI think I might have gotten this wrong because some sources mention different orderings. But based on my general understanding, these are the ten largest African nations by population.\n</think>\n\nNigeria (1), Kenya (2), Uganda (3), Zimbabwe (4), Namibia (5), Lesotho (6), Burundi (7), Republic of the Congo (8), and Republic of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (9)."

The user already provided a detailed answer, but maybe I can think through it again to ensure accuracy.\n\nFirst, Scorpius is part of the Ursa Major region, right? And within that, there's the Sagittarius and Perseus parts. So, the main stars here are Scorpio 1 and Scorpio 2. They're binary systems, which means they orbit around a common center of mass.\n\nScorpio 1 is associated with NGC 5 from the Large Magellanic Cloud. I remember that it's a tight binary system where the two neutron stars are very close together. This one has been observed in great detail by astronomers, so its behavior is well-studied.\n\nScorpio 2, on the other hand, is part of NGC 1333, which I believe is the NGM (Neutron star merger) binary. Both neutron stars are in close proximity and have been studied extensively for their merger events. This system has provided valuable data for understanding gravitational wave detection.\n\nThe user also mentioned another binary system called Scorpio 4, but I'm not sure where it falls. It might be associated with the Andromeda-Helical cluster, which is a nearby group. Since they're part of Andromeda, and Scorpius is in Ursa Major, their position isn't overlapping, so I'll mention that.\n\nI should make sure to explain why these are binary systems. Binary neutron stars orbit each other because of gravitational force, which causes them to emit detectable radiation. This radiation can be observed as the pulsation of individual stars or as a combined signal in observations.\n\nAlso, it's important to note their distance from Earth and how that affects their visibility. The closer they are, the more likely they will be detected, but these systems are quite far apart compared to nearby stars like our Sun or the Milky Way's center.\n\nI should structure my answer clearly, listing each star with its classification and association, making sure to explain their characteristics as binary systems. This way, someone reading it can understand why these specific stars are in Scorpius without needing prior knowledge.\n</think>\n\nScorpio 1: NGC 5 (Large Magellanic Cloud)  \nScorpio 2: NGC 1333 (Neutron star merger)  \nScorpio 4: Andromeda-Helical Cluster"

        "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what buildings are named after JFK. Hmm, I remember seeing some names of buildings that seem related to his name, but I'm not sure about all of them. Let's start with the obvious ones.\n\nFirst off, JFK stands for John F. Kennedy, so I know the JFK Memorial on JFK International Airport comes to mind. That one's definitely a building named after him. Then there might be the JFK Tower somewhere, maybe in New York City or some other place near JFK. But wait, I think it's actually the building at 123 Broadway that's named after him? Or was it the terminal?\n\nI'm trying to remember if there are other notable buildings nearby. The Johnsons come to mind too—both Kennedy and Johnson have houses on the same street. I believe the Johnsons Home is somewhere around JFK, maybe in the Midtown area. That might be one.\n\nWhat about other neighborhoods named after him? I think there's a building called JFK Plaza in New York City. Or perhaps the building with John F. Kennedy statue on top of it? Wait, I'm not sure if that's named after him specifically or just as a reference. Maybe the building with the statue is more relevant.\n\nI also recall seeing names like JFK Tower somewhere, but I think the actual terminal is at 123 Broadway. That's probably in New York City. Is there another building near JFK that's famous? The Johnsons Home was mentioned before, so maybe that's one building as well.\n\nWait, are there more buildings named after him? Maybe some other places or different locations. I'm trying to think if there's a skyscraper named JFK or a hotel called John F. Kennedy Hotel. Oh, the JFK Building (formerly Johnson Tower) is in New York City, but maybe that's not exactly the building with the statue.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other public buildings or complexes named after him. The Johnsons might have another property nearby, but I'm not sure about their names. Maybe a convention center or something else? I don't recall any immediately.\n\nLet me try to list what I know so far: JFK Memorial, JFK Tower (at 123 Broadway), Johnsons Home in the Midtown area, and maybe JFK Plaza. But I'm not certain if those are all accurate. It might be best to confirm each one just to make sure they're correctly named after him.\n\nWait a second, there's also the building at 565 Elm Street in New York City called The Johnsons Home. That would definitely fall under it. So that adds another building to my list.\n\nIs there any other building or place near JFK that I'm missing? Maybe a hotel or a restaurant with the name John F. Kennedy? Or perhaps a convention center or a museum? I don't have enough information on those, so maybe it's better to stick with what I know is correct based on memory and facts.\n\nSo putting it all together, the buildings named after JFK are likely the JFK Memorial, the JFK Tower, the Johnsons Home in the Midtown area of New York City, and possibly The Johnsons Home in 565 Elm Street. There might be others, but I'm not entirely sure without further research.\n</think>\n\nThe buildings named after John F.

These are all major European nations.\n\nLooking further out, the UK is a big part of the EU too. countries like the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, and several others.

I believe it's connected to some countries in Central and East Africa. Maybe Ethiopia? Yes, they share land with each other. Then there's Kenya, which is another one nearby. So those are two countries right there.\n\nMoving on, I think Ghana also touches into the Middle East or something similar. Maybe Jordanian territories or something like that? Or perhaps it's an Arab country. Let me think... Oh yeah, maybe Jordan and perhaps Iran too? Wait, does Jordan border Ghana? Hmm, not sure about that one. Maybe it's a bit more specific.\n\nI remember that Ghana is in the Western part of West Africa. So there might be some African countries on its west side. I think about Equatorial Guinea first. It's directly west of Ghana and is a country in West Africa. So that's another bordering country.\n\nThen moving north, I'm trying to recall which other countries are adjacent. There's maybe Somalia?

Also, the Middle East countries like Jordan (maybe) or perhaps other Arab territories.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely sure about some of these names. Maybe I should think more carefully about each bordering country. Let's start with Ethiopia: yes, they are adjacent. Then Kenya: definitely next to it. Then Central African Republic includes countries like Gabon on the west and Senegal/Sudan in the north.\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo is also a significant one because it borders both Ghana and Nigeria.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what diseases are associated with the gene FGF14. First, I should probably understand what FGF stands for and who it's referring to. FGF is a short for fibroblast growth factor, which are signaling molecules involved in cell differentiation and development. They play roles in various tissues and processes.\n\nNow, I remember that FGFs can regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and metabolism. Different tissues express different subsets of these factors. For example, T3 (endothelial) fate cells might be regulated more by certain FGFs than other cells like T4 (smooth muscle).\n\nI'm not sure about the specific FGF14 gene itself, but I think it's involved in various bodily processes. One thing that comes to mind is its role in development, particularly in the formation of organs like the liver and pancreas. The liver has several layers with distinct FGF signaling pathways.\n\nWait, does FGF14 relate to organ-specific diseases? Maybe there are conditions where defects in this gene lead to specific growth issues. I recall hearing about a condition called polydactyly of the arm, which is an arm development defect. That might be linked to FGF signaling issues because FGF14 could play a role in regulating cells that produce proteins involved in growth.\n\nAnother possibility is conditions related to organ failure or dysfunction, like multiple radiating pheochromocytoma (MRPC). MRPC is an organ-specific condition where multiple layers of the liver cause damage. If FGF14 isn't expressed properly, it might lead to such issues. I think FGFs influence T3 fate cells, which are often implicated in MRPC.\n\nI'm not sure about other conditions though. Maybe there are other developmental disorders connected to FGF signaling? Or perhaps it's more related to autoimmune diseases or hormonal disorders?\n\nAlso, the user asked for an exhaustive list separated by",

So I should make a comprehensive list focusing on known conditions linked to FGF14.\n\nI think about FGFs regulating T3 fate cells in different organs:\n\n- Liver: Perhaps issues with organ-specific T3 fate.\n- pancreas: Maybe some pancreatic disorders tied to FGF signaling.\n- Other tissues like muscles, skin perhaps?\n\nWait, maybe there's a specific condition for the liver called multiple radiating pheochromocytoma? I'm not entirely sure about that.\n\nI should consider other potential conditions. There's also the concept of \"fibrinogen\" which is FGF14 itself, but wait, no—FGF14 is actually a protein product, not a growth factor. The growth factors are FGFs, and FGF14 refers to one specific protein.\n\nMaybe it's involved in conditions related to liver fibrosis or related issues?\n\nWait, the user mentioned the gene FGF14, so perhaps it's a part of a signaling pathway that is misregulated leading to diseases like MRPC. Alternatively, it might be involved in organ development and cause some developmental disorders beyond just T3.\n\nI'm not entirely certain about all the specific conditions linked with FGF14. However, I can list known ones: multiple radiating pheochromocytoma (MRPC) because FGFs are part of its regulation; polydactyly of the arm due to FGF signaling in T3 cells leading to arm development issues; organ-specific diseases like fibrotic liver conditions; and possible developmental disorders involving different T3 fate cell types.\n\nSo putting that together, I can structure a list with these points.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which elementary particles interact with both the strong force and the weak force. Hmm, where do I start? Well, I remember that elementary particles have different interactions based on their types. The strong force is what holds things like protons and neutrons together inside atoms. That must be the gluons, right? And they're carriers of the strong interaction.\n\nNow, for the weak force, which interacts with lighter particles. I think electrons are one of them because they have electric charge. But wait, protons also interact with the weak force but through something called the weak nuclear force. Oh yeah, and neutrinos—those definitely participate in the weak interaction. What else? Maybe photons? No, photons are electromagnetic waves, not interacting directly with these forces. Muons, I think they do too because they have electric charge. And what about quarks? They carry color charges, which means they interact via the strong force.\n\nWait, but how do I know if other particles like pions or kaons interact? I'm pretty sure pions are neutral and interact through the strong force as well. Kaons are another type of meson that also interacts with the strong force due to something called isovector symmetry. So putting it all together: electrons, muons, neutrinos, quarks (including down-type quarks), photons don't do much here. Pions and kaons interact through the strong force, but protons are weakly interacting because they have a small charge compared to other particles.\n\nSo my list should include electrons, muons, neutrinos, quarks (down-type: up, charm, strange; down, top, bottom), pions, kaons. I think that's all for the weak force. For strong force, it's gluons and color charges in quarks.\n</think>\n\nelectron, muon, neutrino, quark (including down-type quarks: up, charm, strange; down, top, bottom), pion, kaon"

        "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking about elementary particles that interact via the weak force. Hmm, I remember that the weak force is one of the four fundamental forces in physics. It's different from the strong and electromagnetic forces because it doesn't act over long distances. \n\nWait, right, the weak force acts on short-range interactions. So what particles are involved here? I think they might be leptons, especially the charged ones like electrons and neutrinos. But wait, do all leptons interact with the weak force? Or is it just certain types?\n\nI recall that quarks are involved in other forces, but maybe not the weak one. The strong force holds quarks together, right? So the particles that interact via the weak force probably don't form clusters like hadrons because the strong force dominates there.\n\nLet me think about specific particles. Neutrinos and electrons come to mind because they carry electric charge and interact through the weak force. But what about other leptons like muons or tauons? I don't believe they do, since their charges might not be affected by the weak force in the same way as electrons. So maybe only the charged leptons are involved.\n\nI should also consider neutrinos again. They don't interact via the strong force because they're neutral, but can interact with other particles through the weak force. So that's another one. What about quarks? No, quarks are in hadrons and don't do anything through the weak force; they're confined within them.\n\nSo compiling this, I think the elementary particles involved would be electrons, neutrinos (both types, like electron neutrino and muon neutrino), and maybe other leptons if any. But from what I remember, only these specific charged leptons interact via the weak force.\n</think>\n\nelectromagnetic force: none  \nstrong nuclear force: not relevant for this question  \nweak nuclear force: electrons, neutrinos (both types)  \n\nno answer"

        "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this question about hybrid species and their offspring. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if hybrid species can have offspring. Hmm, that's a common question in biology. I remember that hybrids are formed when two different species mate and produce offspring. But wait, do those offspring always survive?\n\nI recall something about hybridization experiments. Even though hybrids result from crossbreeding, not all of their offspring might survive because they can't reproduce properly. So some offsprings won't survive the first few generations.\n\nBut does that mean no offspring at all? Or just a few? I think it's possible to have some viable hybrids. Like how certain plants and animals are hybridized but not all produce fertile offspring. It's about genetic compatibility—some traits might actually work together, others not so much.\n\nSo the answer isn't straightforward. They can sometimes have viable offspring, especially if the species' genes complement each other well. But even then, it's a small number of survivors.\n\nPutting this together, I should explain that yes, hybrid species can have some offspring, but only those with compatible genetic traits will survive and reproduce. This makes sense because evolution usually favors combinations where traits work best together.\n</think>\n\nhybrid species can sometimes have viable offspring through crossbreeding experiments. However, not all individuals may survive or produce fertile offspring due to potential genetic incompatibilities. While some hybrid species might have a small number of survivors that are able to reproduce and propagate their genes effectively.\n\n**Answer:** Yes, hybrid species can have offspring, but only those with compatible genetic traits will survive and reproduce."

So, Tharsis would be one of those mountains that originated from a specific place.\n\nWait, I'm not entirely sure about the origin. It might have come from another language or culture. Maybe it's from Greek? Yeah, Tharsis is an ancient name, and in Latin, it translates to \"mountain from the sea.\" So, Tharsis Montes would be a mountain that originated from a sea, probably related to the Mediterranean.\n\nI remember hearing about places called \"Himalayas\" or \"Mountains of the East,\" but I'm not sure if those are the same as Tharsis. Maybe Tharsis refers specifically to an ancient region in North Africa? Or perhaps it's more regional than that. I should look up a few names that come to mind.\n\nOh, right! The Pyramids of Giza are famous for their massive pyramids, and they're in Egypt, which is part of North Africa. But are they Tharsis Montes? No, those would be called Giza Mountains or similar terms. I think the name Tharsis might refer to a different set of mountains.\n\nWait, I'm confusing some names here. Let me try again. The term Tharsis comes from Greek Ταλάς (Tálas), which means \"land\" or \"country.\" So, perhaps these Montes originated in a land that is sometimes referred to as Tharsis? Maybe it's tied to the Mediterranean region.\n\nLooking up Tharsis Montes on a map, I don't see any prominent names of mountains associated with that. The highest mountain from Tharsis might be something like Mount Tharsis or Mount Euphrates, but those are probably not named after Tharsis. Alternatively, maybe it's one of the more recently discovered mountains in North Africa.\n\nWait, I think there's a mountain called the Zizzi, which is part of the Black Mountains. But that's probably not from Tharsis. Maybe another name? Or perhaps these Montes are a subset of larger groups like the Lascaux or the Tethys Mountains?\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck here because I can't recall any specific names associated with Tharsis Montes. It might be more about regional mountains or less known discoveries in North Africa than major names like Mount Everest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Tharsis\" refers to the sea, and Tharsis Montes is a mountain that rises from that sea. In that case, it would be in the Mediterranean region, but I don't recognize any specific name for such mountains off the top of my head.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other interpretations. Maybe \"Tharsis\" is part of a broader term or an older language term used to describe these mountains. But without more context, it's hard to pin down exact names.\n\nSince I can't recall specific names and the information isn't clear, maybe it refers to a group or region that's not widely recognized as Tharsis Montes. Alternatively, perhaps it's referencing lesser-known or recently discovered mountains in North Africa, but I'm not sure of their names.\n\nIn conclusion, without more context or specific knowledge about these montes, I can't confidently list them. It might be a term used in regional geology discussions or historical studies that are not widely known, so the response should reflect that uncertainty.\n</think>\n\nno answer"

I think she was a big name in American literature, so definitely, books about crime and literature come to mind.\n\nI remember her first novel is \"To Kill a Mockingbird.\" That one's pretty famous, wasn't it? It's about a young girl named Scout Finch who gets involved with a case involving Tom Robinson. I think that was in the early 20th century. So that's definitely one of hers.\n\nNow, after \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" she wrote more crime novels. The next one comes to mind: \"The Man Who Was Looking for the Women.\" I believe that's about Harriet Tratchen, a novel set in a small town in 1840s America. That sounds right.\n\nThen there was \"The Woman in the Spider Web,\" which was set in a rural area of New York. It was another crime mystery.

It's a classic, I think it came out around the mid-20th century. So that's four.\n\nI think after that comes \"The House at Poquonkey,\" which is a bit darker and more complex.

Retina homeostasis refers to the normal functioning and regulation of the retina's function. It must involve maintaining the structure and function of the retina, which are essential for vision.\n\nI should start by recalling major players in the eye and eye movement systems because the retina is a key part of both. The retinal pigment cells, or rods, are crucial for light perception. Then there's the cone cells, the blue light receptors, which are important for night vision.\n\nMoving on, the retina also plays a role in muscle contraction. I remember that the lens muscles, particularly those controlled by the barrel and cornea nuclei, can contract, even at night when the cones are off. That must be involved in eye movement control, like looking at something moving or changing direction.\n\nTissular structures might play a part too. The outer retinary cells around the retina sense pressure from the eye and help maintain the shape and structure. Also, there's something called the pigment epithelium above the retina; it helps regulate blood flow to the retina, which is important for its function.\n\nNeurotransmitters must be involved in communication between different parts of the eye and the brain. The rod cells send signals to the brain via the rods' receptors, while the cone cells communicate through their receptors on the retina itself. Both involve the photoreceptors, so that's a link there.\n\nThere might also be signaling pathways. The retinal ganglion cells, which are the highest order ganglion cells, form circuits with other parts of the nervous system to control eye movements and sensation. These pathways help maintain homeostasis by ensuring everything is in sync.\n\nOther tissues like the hypothesis, nucleus retinoius, and pigmentissime might also contribute through their roles in cell signaling and tissue repair. The nucleus retinoius deals with photoreceptor cells, so it's part of the signal processing there.\n\nI should make sure to list all these proteins clearly without using abbreviations or acronyms, spelling them out every time. It's important to be thorough but concise since the user asked for a comprehensive yet succinct list.\n\nLet me check if I covered all major areas: rods, cones, lens muscles, outer retinary cells, tissular structures, neurotransmitters, pathways, other tissues, and their roles in homeostasis. That should cover it.\n</think>",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which radio stations in Boston broadcast specifically. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that Boston is a major city in the U.S., so there are probably some key stations there. I know that 103.7 AM on the AM radio network is pretty famous because it's the DJ's station for the Boston Public Switchboard (BPSB). That makes sense since BPSB uses the Boston AM radio network.\n\nThen, I think of the FM station. The 98.5 FM station, which is in Boston as the Boston FM Radio Co., that must be one of them. It's known for its sports talk or perhaps more generally for its local news.\n\nNow, checking out other stations, I recall the 107.7 AM radio station on BC. That sounds familiar too; it's another major station used in Boston by BPSB as well.\n\nI also remember the 95.3 FM station nearby, which is probably the local FM network there. It's likely responsible for public events or community programming.\n\nAnother one I'm thinking of is the 108.7 AM radio in the area. That must be the Boston Public Radio Network (BPRN), which would cover news and other programs.\n\nAre there any others? Maybe the 92.3 AM station near the end of town, but I'm not sure if that's a major one or just part of a smaller network. Probably not the most prominent.\n\nWait, are there any stations outside of BPSB FM that broadcast locally in Boston? I'm less certain about that, but perhaps some community radio stations. But since the question is specifically about those that broadcast only in Boston and not elsewhere, maybe these are the main ones.\n\nSo compiling this, I think the key stations are 103.7 AM (BPSB), 98.5 FM (Boston FM Co.), 107.7 AM (BC), 95.3 FM (local network), and 108.7 AM (BPRN). That seems like a comprehensive list without adding any extra numbers or acronyms.\n</think>",

        "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out which religions promote vegetarianism. Let me start by recalling what I know about each religion and their practices.\n\nFirst, I remember that many major religions around the world have vegetarian lifestyles. Christianity is definitely on the list because it's a widely followed belief system. It values the sanctity of life and often leads people to eat healthier options in their diet.\n\nNext, Islam also promotes vegetarianism. While most Muslims follow strict dietary practices, certain groups like Shajah and Sunnis might adopt more vegetarian lifestyles. They emphasize health and spiritual practices over meat products.\n\nHinduism has its own set of beliefs too. Hinduism values harmony with nature, which can lead to a vegetarian lifestyle as part of their overall approach to eating. They often eat less meat for health reasons but are still open to modifications based on personal choice.\n\nMesoamerican religions like Yucatán (\\*) and Tlhis (***) have diverse practices. Yucatán emphasizes self-sufficiency, which might lean towards vegetarianism as a natural part of their way of life, especially in regions where they're adapted to rely more on the environment for food.\n\nIbn Tofa' (Baha’i) is another significant one. While they primarily follow fasts and emphasize good deeds over material wealth, some followers have adopted vegetarianism, though it's not a widespread practice across all members.\n\nDiplomats of Islam such as Sharia (Shari) and Qiyat (Qiyat) have developed their own vegetarian traditions, focusing on ethical living by eating plant-based foods as part of their approach to health and spirituality.\n\nMesoamerican traditions like Cuzco (\\*\\*) and Aztec (\\*\\*\\*) often revolve around the idea of growing plants for sustenance. The Aztec specifically uses only edible plants, which is a form of vegetarianism in their society.\n\nIn traditional Chinese religions like Mawangdui and Tze, plant-based foods are heavily emphasized as part of their diet. Even though there's some debate about whether they're true vegetarians or just following a healthier lifestyle, they have significant plant consumption.\n\nOther religions such as Buddhist and Hinduism typically follow vegetarian practices based on religious teachings. Buddhism emphasizes mental discipline and often incorporates plant-based foods into its rituals, while Hinduism does too, aligning with their spiritual beliefs.\n\nHinduism is also a part of the caste system in India, which further supports vegetarianism by promoting harmony among different groups.\n\nReligious traditions from various cultures, like the Greek Orthodox and African traditions, have diverse ways of living. For example, the Greek Orthodox Church often eats plant-based dishes as part of their spiritual practices. Some African religions like Kwa’apa (\\*\\*) and Zulu (\\*\\*\\*) are also vegetarian or closely follow vegetarian principles.\n\nIt's important to note that some beliefs don't promote vegetarianism at all. For instance, certain interpretations of Judaism can result in practices where members may eat meat, though they might consider it a form of spiritual nourishment rather than a strict vegetarian choice.\n\nTo sum up, many major religions across the globe have strong vegetarian tendencies, particularly Christianity, Islam, and others with specific traditions that encourage moderation. It's important to recognize that these are personal choices depending on one's beliefs.\n</think>\n\nUnited States of America  \nCanada  \nMexico  \nUnited Kingdom  \nAustralia  \nNew Zealand  \nUnited States  \nIndia  \nChina  \nIndonesia  \nPhilippines  \nGreece  \nUSA  \nSpain  \nFrance  \nGermany  \nCzech Republic  \nPoland  \nNetherlands  \nBelgium  \nSwitzerland  \nCroatia  \nSlovakia  \nCzechia  \nHungary  \nSlovenia  \nCroatia  \nUnited Kingdom  \nNetherlands  \nBelgium  \nAustria  \nAmerika Samara  \nMalaysia  \nPhilippines  \nVietnam  \nIndia  \nChina  \nSouth Africa  \nWest Africa  \nAustralia  \nNew Zealand  \nGermany  \n\nMesoamerican religions (\\*)  \nYucatán (\\*\\*)  \nTlhis (***)  \n\nInnate religious beliefs such as Christianity, Islam, and Mawangdui (Buddhism) in many cultures often promote vegetarianism as a natural part of their spiritual practices."

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what species are in the order Monotremata. Hmm, that's a bit new to me. Let me start by breaking down the question.\n\nFirst, \"Monotremata\" sounds like it's a genus of a plant family. I remember reading about plant families before; they're groups of related plants sharing similar traits. So maybe each genus is a group within a family.\n\nNow, the order refers to the division in the hierarchy. Families are above orders, which in turn are above classes or species. So Monotremata would be a family, and then perhaps an order below it?\n\nI'm not too sure about specific plant families. Let me think... I know some common ones like Euphorbia for flowers, but Monotremata doesn't ring any bells. Maybe I should check if there are any species named Monotremata in botany literature.\n\nWait, maybe \"Monotremata\" is a genus within an order that includes some well-known plants. Or perhaps it's a newly discovered family or order. Since I don't have specific knowledge on this, the best course of action would be to recall if there are any species with that genus name.\n\nI'm not sure about Monotremata. Maybe in certain regions or languages, it refers to something else? Alternatively, could it be a misspelling or misnaming from another term?\n\nSince I can't remember any specific plants with that genus and don't have information on an order below it, I might need to inform the user if I'm unsure. So, in this case, I should say that without more context or research, I couldn't provide a specific answer.\n\nLet me also consider if \"Monotremata\" is part of a larger family or order. If Monotremata were a genus within an order like Annona or another family with known species, that would help. But since I don't have that information, it's tricky.\n\nI think the safest approach here is to explain that based on my current knowledge and without additional context, there aren't any specific plant species in Monotremata. It might be a newly discovered genus or part of an order that isn't widely recognized.\n</think>\n\nidk"

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll think of teams that are known for using sticks in their sport. There's the slippery slope hockey team, right? They have those really cute skates with ice and sticks on them. That makes sense because the stick is a cool feature.\n\nNext, I'm trying to remember if there are other sports like this. Maybe something with a long history... Oh, cross country. The cross country team uses sticks for their running gear, like the poles or sprockets, which help them cover more distance. That seems plausible.\n\nI also recall soccer has some specialized teams. One that comes to mind is the penalty shootout team. They use sticks in the penalty shootout to score quickly and sometimes to pass the ball down the field. That's a bit of an oddity but possible.\n\nBasketball might have another stick-related feature. Oh, maybe the \"stick man\" or stick players on the bench? Those are usually guys known for being very strong and can use them as props. So they might use sticks as part of their game strategy during wins.\n\nThe hockey team is already mentioned, so I should confirm about the stick skates used by the slippery slope team to make sure it's accurate.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if there are others, but for now, these four teams seem like the most obvious ones with significant stick usage. Maybe adding a few more to cover different sports? Let me think... Oh, maybe there's something in track and field called the \"slippery slope\" event or another term where sticks are used on the track.\n\nWait, no, I'm not recalling that. So sticking with the four main ones: slippery slope hockey, cross country, soccer penalty shootout team, and hockey.

Bullets can be pretty destructive, especially when used for purposes like this. Are there other weapons mentioned sometimes? Maybe something like a knife or a dagger? Yeah, that makes sense because different people might use different tools during such events.\n\nThen there's the possibility of an automatic weapon. I think some firearms were locked and couldn't be retrieved easily. Was a semiauto weapon involved? That sounds familiar. Also, maybe a gun with a manual trigger? Definitely, I've seen that before in contexts where people are around weapons.\n\nI don't recall hearing about any heavy machinery or tools being used because the focus was more on shooting, not something like a_s大型机械_。So, probably no cars or tractors were part of the incidents. Also, no fireworks—those tend to be used for larger fires, not individual shots.\n\nThere might have been some kind of warning system.

I remember hearing about Rosedale before; that seems significant. They must be the oldest whisky distillery in the world because Rosedale was established in 1906 by Jameson.\n\nThen there's The Rye Co., based in Clontáin, County Tyrone.

Hmm, I remember that in some countries, especially in East Asia, women often make significant contributions to governance, but I'm not sure if their universities even designate them as rectors.\n\nFirst, I should consider which Asian countries are known for having female leaders. Japan comes to mind because they have a strong female presence in politics and business. Like, the government seems to support progressive reforms, which would include female representatives. So maybe universities there do designate some women as professors or rectors.\n\nThen, South Korea is another country that's been making waves for gender equality.

So maybe universities in India do designate some female faculty members as rectors.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if any Asian universities explicitly name their female leaders as rectors. It might be more about the presence of women in the institutions rather than specific roles being designated.

It might be challenging to provide a comprehensive list without consulting university websites or specific departments. So it's possible that no one knows the exact list offhand.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"rector\" can refer to more than just leadership. In some contexts, it could also mean a rector in a different sense, like a student representative. But I think in this case, they are referring to the administrative role of head or director.\n\nOverall, while there's evidence of women making significant contributions and possibly being represented as rectors in Asian universities, it's not a common practice for all institutions.

I'm trying to think if any are famous. Oh, maybe someone like Jordan Broussard from the NFL (propositionally). He's from Canada and the US. So he has citizenships in both countries for his professional life. But does that count as having two citizenships?\n\nWait, but does that mean he only had one country where he was a citizen? Or are they considered dual because of different countries? I think when you're from multiple countries, your citizenship is separate, so that counts as two.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone like Maradonna, but wait, that's for the original American football team. Maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother angle: in some countries, especially where there are strict regulations on cross-border citizenships, people might claim multiple citizenships. But I'm not sure if any football players have this status specifically in association football.\n\nI should also consider that while some athletes may have dual citizenship due to their background, the question is asking for those who have at least two. So maybe the answer includes players like Maradonna from the US and Canada, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, perhaps the user meant American football players, so it's about the NFL. There are many American NFL players with multiple citizenships because they represent different countries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the association football players who have at least two citizenships might include those from different countries where they were adopted or recognized as citizens. The example of Maradonna fits here, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the only one. There could be others too, depending on their nationality and how they've been recognized.\n\nI think it's time to conclude that while there are several players with dual citizenships in association football, the most prominent examples might be players like Maradonna from Canada and the US, as he was a two-time champion from each country. This would satisfy having at least two citizenships.\n</think>\n\nThe answer is:\nMaradonna has citizenships in both Canada and the United States.\n\nAnswer:",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which buildings are considered brutalist based on the user's question. Let me start by understanding what \"brutalist\" means in this context. From my limited knowledge, I think brutalism is related to architecture, particularly focusing on how buildings function and look in relation to human needs and emotions.\n\nI remember that brutalist architects aimed for a strong emotional connection with the spaces. They focused on making buildings feel significant and alive. This approach often involved incorporating natural elements like wood, stone, or earthwork. I think they also used large volumes of materials to create a sense of weight and importance.\n\nNow, thinking about famous brutalist buildings. The Eiffel Tower comes to mind because it's massive and stands as a symbol of strength. In Paris, France, there are a lot of brutalist structures like the Arc de Triomphe, Le Marais Museum, and the Louvre. These places reflect the impact of brutalism.\n\nI wonder about other cities too. Maybe in other countries? I know some European cities like Madrid have a mix of traditional and brutalist elements, but I'm not sure if they're considered brutalist per se. They might use more urban planning to accommodate large volumes while still showing emotional resonance.\n\nIn New York, the Empire State Building is iconic, but I don't recall it being brutalist. It's big and stands out, which makes people feel like it's significant. So maybe not all of them are brutalist, but many in different contexts.\n\nI should also consider specific buildings or landmarks. There's the Guggenheim Museum, which was brutalist, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The American Museum of Natural History might have some brutalist influences too, especially with their use of stone and large volumes.\n\nI'm trying to remember other cities. Maybe the Louvre in Paris has its own brutalist elements since it's part of the capital. Also, the National Gallery in Washington D.C. I think they're big buildings that were designed for a purpose, reflecting the human experience.\n\nAre there any exceptions? Perhaps some modern or newer developments might not be brutalist anymore if they don't fit the emotional resonance model. But without specific information, it's hard to tell.\n\nPutting this together, the user wants an exhaustive list of buildings that are brutalist. I should compile a list with names and regions, noting whether each is considered brutalist based on their design and purpose. I need to avoid any mention of other approaches like functionalism or minimalist designs unless they directly tie into brutalism.\n\nI'll go through some key cities: Paris has the Eiffel Tower, Marais Museum, Louvre, etc. Madrid might have some urban Brutalist elements. New York has Empire State Building and others with big volumes. I should list these buildings with their respective regions to make it clear.\n</think>\n\nThe buildings that are considered brutalist include:\n\n- **Eiffel Tower**: Paris\n- **Arc de Triomphe**: Paris\n- **Marais Museum**: Paris\n- **Louvre**:Paris\n- **Guggenheim Museum**: New York\n- **National Gallery**: Washington, D.C.\n- **American Museum of Natural History**: New York\n- **New York Times Building**: New York\n- **Empire State Building**: New York\n\nThese buildings reflect a strong emotional connection with their spaces through significant volume and design."

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which buildings are functionalist based on the information given. Let's start by understanding what functionalism is. From what I remember, functionalism is a school of thought in political philosophy that argues for certain general principles of social organization and conduct. It was developed in the late 19th century, especially during the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe user has listed several buildings: the United States Capitol Building, Empire State Building, Empire State Building Tower, Eiffel Tower, Eiffel Tower observation deck, Empire State Building Observation Deck, New York City Museum of Fine Arts, Times Square, Golden Gate Bridge, Eiffel Tower Bridge, Empire State Building Bridge, Statue of Liberty, and the Burj Khalifa.\n\nI think functionalism would look at each building's purpose. Let me go through them one by one.\n\n1. **United States Capitol Building**: This must be a major public building with significant historical and political significance. It supports government functions, which aligns with functionalist views that consider community services as part of government work.\n\n2. **Empire State Building**: Known for its impressive architecture and grandeur. Functionalism might view it as a symbol of grand society, so it's likely included.\n\n3. **Empire State Building Tower (Eiffel Tower)? Wait, no, the Eiffel Tower is on the Empire Level. The top part is called the Tower. I think the Eiffel Tower itself isn't functionalist; it's more about design and architecture than government support.\n\n4. **Eiffel Tower Observation Deck**: This is a historical building that offers views of the Eiffel Bridge, so it has historical significance. Functionalism supports history as part of society.\n\n5. **Empire State Building Observation Deck**: Similar to the observation deck but on the Empire Level. It's an elevated area with architecture and perhaps some government functions like surveillance or security.\n\n6. **New York City Museum of Fine Arts (MFA)**: A major cultural institution, functionalist might view it for its role in supporting fine arts education and cultural activities, which are part of a broader societal function.\n\n7. **Times Square**: A significant urban area known for its nightlife and entertainment, so it has social functions and community support as per functionalism.\n\n8. **Golden Gate Bridge**: This is an engineering marvel, not directly related to public or government functions. It's about transportation and engineering support.\n\n9. **Eiffel Tower Bridge (Tunnel)**: A historical structure built for transport across the river. Functionalists might see it as a significant public infrastructure project.\n\n10. **Empire State Building Bridge**: Another major engineering bridge, likely supporting traffic or navigation.\n\n11. **Statue of Liberty**: An iconic symbol representing freedom and democracy. Functionalists would view it for its symbolism and historical significance in expressing principles of freedom.\n\n12. **Burj Khalifa (Tallest Building)**: A skyscraper with clear public function as a tourist attraction, providing revenue through ticket sales and marketing. Functionalists might support it for its economic use.\n\nSo, the buildings that are functionalist include those centered around government support ( Capitol, Empire Level Observation Deck, MFA, Eiffel Tower Observation Deck), historical significance (Eiffel Tower, Golden Gate Bridge, Statue of Liberty), public infrastructure (Empire State Building, Eiffel Tower Bridge, MFA bridge), and unique symbols like the Burj Khalifa for their function as tourist attraction. I think that's all.\n\nWait, let me double-check each building to make sure I didn't miss anything. The Empire State Building Tower is actually called the Tower, not the Eiffel Tower, so it's a different structure. The Burj Khalifa is unique in its design and purpose for height.\n\nI believe that covers all of them. Now, let me format this into the required list with each building separated by '",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which carbon isotopes can decay into boron isotopes. Let's start by breaking this down.\n\nFirst, I know that carbon has a bunch of isotopes: regular carbon-12, carbon-13, and the heavier ones like carbon-14. Boron is a lighter element with isotopes too—boron-10, boron-11, boron-12. But wait, boron-10 isn't stable because it undergoes beta decay to become carbon-10, I think.\n\nSo, the question is about decay chains or radioactive decay processes. Carbon typically decays through various alpha and beta emissions, right? So maybe starting from a heavier carbon isotope can lead to a lighter element like boron after emitting certain particles.\n\nLet me list some isotopes of carbon:\n\n- C12 (Carbon-12)\n- C13 (Carbon-13)\n- C14 (Carbon-14)\n\nAnd for boron:\n\n- B10\n- B11\n- B12\n\nNow, I need to see if any carbon isotope can decay to a boron isotope. Let's consider each possible combination.\n\nStarting with C12. Carbon-12 is stable and doesn't decay on its own unless there's a surrounding atom or something nearby. So C12 won't emit particles to become B.\n\nNext, C13. That's a bit more likely because it's heavier. Can C13 decay? Yes, some elements can undergo beta decay where a neutron turns into a proton and emits an electron. For instance, carbon-14 decays by beta minus (β-) decay to nitrogen-14.\n\nWait, but for boron, maybe the process involves more steps. Like, perhaps a carbon isotope could go through several emissions to reach boron. Let's think about the common decay series or half-lives.\n\nCarbon-13 has a longer half-life (~90 years) than carbon-12 (about 800 years). If C13 undergoes alpha decay, that would decrease its atomic number by two. From C13 to B?\n\nWait, no—alpha decay reduces the atomic number by two because it's like pulling off a helium nucleus. So if you have C14, which is carbon-14 (atomic number 6), and do an alpha decay, it becomes nitrogen-14 (atomic number 7). Then what would happen next?\n\nNitrogen-14 can undergo beta-minus decay to become oxygen-14 (atomic number 8). But that's not boron. So maybe C12? Hmm.\n\nWait another angle: Let me think about the possible decay paths where a carbon isotope turns into boron by losing or gaining neutrons and emitting particles.\n\nFor example, let's say a carbon isotope can emit an alpha particle (which is a helium nucleus, so reduces atomic number by 2). Then it might undergo beta decay to increase atomic number. So if C14 decays to N14, then N14 could decay further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe starting from a lighter carbon isotopes like C13 or C12, which are more likely to emit particles, can become B via multiple steps.\n\nWait, another thought: Carbon can also undergo beta minus (β-) emission from high mass numbers. So if a carbon isotope has enough neutrons, it can turn into boron through a series of decays. For instance, let's consider C13 turning into B10.\n\nCarbon-13 (C13) with atomic number 6 and mass number 13. Boron-10 has atomic number 5 and mass number 10.\n\nSo the process would involve losing a neutron to go from 13 to 12, then an alpha decay (losing two protons), but wait that's not possible because you can't lose more protons than you have. Alternatively, maybe through beta minus emissions.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: Carbon-14 decays first into nitrogen via alpha decay. Then, nitrogen-14 might undergo beta-minus decay to oxygen-14. But that doesn't get us anywhere near boron. Maybe a longer chain?\n\nAlternatively, is there a carbon isotope that can lose two neutrons and turn into boron? For instance, if you have C10, which isn't stable, but perhaps it decays. Wait, no—C12 isn't stable.\n\nWait, maybe considering the decay of carbon-14 to nitrogen-14 via alpha decay. Then, is there a way for nitrogen-14 to lose some neutrons and turn into boron? Let's see: Nitrogen-14 (atomic number 7) would need an atomic number change from 7 to 5—that suggests losing two protons or perhaps gaining electrons somehow, which isn't possible unless there's annihilation. So that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait another thought: Carbon can also undergo beta plus decay in certain situations. But I'm not sure if that applies here. Beta plus is when a proton turns into neutron and emits positron, but I don't think that's relevant for carbon turning into boron.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the emission of alpha particles from boron itself? No, because boron is an element with lower atomic number and tends to decay.\n\nWait, perhaps if we have C12 decaying, which is stable. But then it won't become boron.\n\nLet me think about another approach: The difference in atomic numbers. Carbon has 6 protons, boron has 5. So the process would involve losing a proton or changing the number somehow. How?\n\nAlpha decay decreases the atomic number by two because it emits helium (2 protons and 2 neutrons). Beta minus decay increases the atomic number by one.\n\nSo if we have a carbon isotope with Z=6, let's see what happens:\n\n1. Carbon-13 (Z=6, A=13) could undergo alpha decay to become nitrogen-13 (Z=7), but that doesn't help because boron has lower atomic number.\n\n2. Wait, maybe if we consider a longer chain where a carbon isotope goes through multiple decays, losing and gaining protons.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the process involves beta plus emissions from an intermediate state. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, let's think of boron-10 specifically. Boron-10 can decay into carbon-10 via beta minus decay. But wait, we're looking for a carbon isotope going to boron, so perhaps the reverse?\n\nBut no, because in decay chains, the daughter would be more stable than the parent.\n\nWait another angle: Carbon isotopes like C12 (6 protons) could go through multiple decays to reach boron. Let's say we have C14 (7 protons), but wait that's not possible as carbon-14 is atomic number 6, so I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the half-lives: Carbon has a longer half-life than boron, so a heavier carbon isotope might decay into boron. For example, C12 can't stay because it's stable, but maybe in certain isotopic chains.\n\nWait, let me look for known decay paths. I think that carbon-14 decays to nitrogen through alpha emission. Then, what about oxygen? Oxygen-14 then could beta minus decay to become boron?\n\nWait, oxygen is atomic number 8. Boron is 5. So oxygen can't directly lose three protons to become boron. Unless via another process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C12 can emit two alpha particles and turn into something else, but wait, carbon-12 has only 6 protons. Losing two protons would make it C10, which is stable? No, C10 is unstable because it undergoes beta decay to B9+something.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe from a Carbon-13 (which is more likely) decaying via beta minus first, turning into Nitrogen-13. Then, maybe N13 can undergo some other decay?\n\nNitrogen has 7 protons. Losing a proton would make it Carbon-14. That's where I started before.\n\nAlternatively, could carbon isotopes with lower mass numbers (like C12) lose neutrons and gain protons? For instance, from C12 to N13, but that would require an alpha decay plus beta minus or something else, which doesn't make much sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is that no carbon isotopes can decay into boron isotopes because their atomic numbers don't match up. Carbon has Z=6, and boron has Z=5. So any decay chain starting from a heavier carbon would go to higher atomic number elements like nitrogen or oxygen, not boron.\n\nBut wait, let's think about the possibility of intermediate steps. For example, could a carbon isotope lose two protons (alpha decay) followed by another beta minus decay?\n\nIf we have C14 decays as alpha first: C14 → N14 via α. Then N14 can undergo beta-minus decay to become O14.\n\nO14 has Z=8, so could that decay further? Perhaps it goes through more steps to reach B5 (boron-10), but I don't think so because boron is an element before oxygen in the periodic table. So unless there's a way for oxygen to lose two neutrons and turn into boron, which seems unlikely without some other process.\n\nAlternatively, maybe from C12 via beta decay? Let me see: Carbon-12 can undergo β-decay (β-0) if it has an odd number of protons. Wait, carbon is even in protons—so no, beta decay wouldn't occur for carbon isotopes unless perhaps there's a nearby atom that emits a photon and changes the parent.\n\nWait another angle: Maybe the process involves both alpha and beta decays from multiple sources. For example, could a Carbon-12 lose two neutrons (alpha) to become Ne14? Then Ne14 can undergo beta decay. Let me check that. Neon-14 is nitrogen-14, which has Z=7.\n\nThen N14 β-decays to O14 (Z=8). Can oxygen then do anything useful for boron?\n\nAlternatively, could C12 go through a different series of decays? Maybe through alpha decay and some other beta particles. But I'm not sure about the stability or feasibility of these steps.\n\nWait, another thought: Boron-10 is less stable than carbon isotopes because it has Z=5. So for a carbon to turn into boron, perhaps from C12, losing two protons via alpha decay would make it go down, but that doesn't match the boron's lower atomic number.\n\nAlternatively, could there be a decay chain where a Carbon-13 (Z=6) decays via beta minus to become Nitrogen-13 (Z=7), which then somehow becomes Boron. But how?\n\nWait, wait—maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the possible parent and daughter isotopes for boron.\n\nBoron has isotopes B10, B11, B12. Each of these have Z=5, Z=6, Z=7 respectively. So to reach boron from carbon, which is Z=6, you'd need a decay that reduces the atomic number by one (beta plus?), but I don't think beta plus occurs unless in very specific conditions.\n\nWait no—beta minus decreases Z by 1, beta plus increases Z by 1. To go from C-Z=6 to B-Z=5, you need a decrease of one in Z. So that would require a β+ decay? But how can C turn into B via β+ decay?\n\nC is Z=6, so unless there's another process converting it. Maybe through some other element with higher atomic number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from an intermediate state where C could emit a positron (if possible) and change in a way that effectively lowers the Z by one. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, let me think of isotopes beyond what's mentioned. For example, does carbon-16 decay to boron? No, it doesn't have enough neutrons to lose two protons and turn into boron which is much lighter.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps via multiple beta decays or other processes. But I'm not sure how that would work because the atomic numbers don't match.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe the question is about isotopes where a carbon isotope can decay to become a boron isotope through a single alpha and then a beta decay. For example, Carbon-14 (C14) decays via alpha to N14 (Nitrogen), which then undergoes beta decay. But that would take us from C-Z=6 to N-Z=7, not B-Z=5.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is that no carbon isotopes can decay directly into boron isotopes because their atomic numbers don't match and such a decay isn't feasible unless through multiple steps that result in the change needed.\n\nTherefore, after all this thinking, I believe that there are no carbon isotopes that decay into boron isotopes.\n</think>\n\nIf we consider the possible decays from carbon isotopes, none can directly decay into boron isotopes because their atomic numbers do not match. Carbon has an atomic number of 6, while boron has an atomic number of 5. To decay to a boron isotope, a carbon isotope would need to lose an atomic number of one, which typically involves beta plus decay (increasing the atomic number). However, all known carbon isotopes are stable and do not undergo such decays in this context.\n\nThus, no carbon isotopes can decay into boron isotopes through any known process."

        "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which carbon isotopes can recursively decay into boron isotopes. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because both carbon and boron are elements, not isotopes in themselves. But wait, maybe they're talking about isotopes of these elements.\n\nCarbon has several stable isotopes like Carbon-12, Carbon-13, Carbon-14, and some unstable ones too. Boron also has various isotopes—B-10, B-11, B-12—and boron-56 is a common one. I remember that isotopes can decay through various nuclear reactions, right? So the idea here might be about how carbon isotopes decay and if they end up being boron isotopes.\n\nWait, but carbon doesn't usually decay into boron directly because those are different elements with different numbers of protons. Maybe there's a chain reaction or something where a carbon isotope decays to another element which then decays further until it reaches boron. But that seems odd because boron isn't typically formed from carbon through such reactions.\n\nLet me think about isotopes of carbon and boron again. Carbon-12, 13, and 14 are the stable ones; I don't think they decay naturally into boron. However, maybe in some cases like in stars where elements undergo radioactive decay, but that's more about how carbon decays into other elements or how isotopes break down over time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this question is about how carbon isotopes can transform through decay and end up with an isotope of boron, maybe via a series of steps. But boron has different isotopes like B-10 to B-56, so I'm not sure if any would ever be formed from carbon.\n\nWait, could it be about nuclear transformations? For example, does carbon undergo beta decay or other types that could lead to boron, but that's probably a stretch. Beta decay typically involves turning a neutron into a proton and emitting an electron, which is different from what we see in the carbon isotopes unless under extreme conditions.\n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider whether any of these isotopes can decay into another with a similar atomic number? But carbon has 6 protons, boron has 5, so they have different nuclear charges. For them to decay into each other's isotope, there would need to be some kind of change in the number of neutrons or protons that aligns their isotopes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering boron-10 and carbon-12: if Carbon-12 decays into something else that eventually becomes Boron-10. But I don't think that's how it works because decay chains usually involve changes in atomic number or mass number.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question is asking which carbon isotopes can decay recursively into boron isotopes. If none exist, perhaps the answer is 'no answer.' Because through decay processes, carbon isotopes don't lead to boron's specific isotopes unless there's a direct transformation or in a scenario not typically observed.\n\nSo, I think it's best to conclude that no such carbon isotopes can recursively decay into boron isotopes.\n</think>\n\nif the question has no answer, return 'no answer'"

        "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out which chess openings are variations of the Sicilian Defense. Hmm, okay, let's start by breaking this down.\n\nI know that the Sicilian Defense is a standard opening in endgame studies for white. It involves a specific setup where black responds with a double pawn move and then moves their pawns on e4-e5 and d6-d7 to create a robust defense. This sets up two pawns on c3 and f4, which are crucial for the black pieces.\n\nNow, variations of this opening would be different starting positions that still adhere to the principles but offer some flexibility or alternative setups. I remember reading about something called the \"Black Sicilian Defense,\" which is when black has control of e4-e5. That's a variation where black takes an initial pawn advance instead of white.\n\nAnother one might be where black doesn't have to move pawns on d6 and d7 immediately, but that seems less common. Maybe it involves other openings or different pawn structures? I'm not sure about that. There's also the \"Black King Defense,\" which isn't exactly a variation of Sicilian, but it's another opening with its own setup.\n\nWait, maybe there are variations where white doesn't take e4-e5 right away. That might be more complicated. Or perhaps after the initial Sicilian, white can move differently on their first few moves to offer variety in response.\n\nI'm a bit confused about whether \"variations\" refer specifically to different starting positions or if they also include different responses. But since the question is about openings themselves, I think it's about the different setups that are variations of the Sicilian.\n\nAlso, considering the user mentioned needing an exhaustive list separated by",
        "and not using acronyms or abbreviations. So each opening must be clearly named without abbreviating them.\n\nLet me try to recall if there are other openings related to the Sicilian. Oh yeah, I think \"Black Sicilian Defense\" is a common variation where black has e4-e5. Then there's the \"White Sicilian Defense,\" which is when white takes e4-e5, but that might be considered a different opening.\n\nWait, no, I think variations are about different structures rather than just taking initial pawns. So perhaps \"Black Sicilian Defense\" and \"White Sicilian Defense\" are both variations where each side controls e4-e5 initially.\n\nAre there other openings under the same term? Maybe \"King Safety Opening,\" but that's a specific variation for when the king is protected. Or perhaps \"Naked Sicilian Defense,\" which might involve some different setup, like not taking pawns on d6 and d7 immediately.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"Sesame Street Defense\" or something similar, though I'm not certain about that. It seems less likely as a variation of the traditional Sicilian.\n\nI think the main variations would be Black's initial pawn advance, the black king defense (which isn't a variation), and the White Sicilian Defense. But since the question is about variations, maybe it includes both sides' pawns on e4-e5 but that seems redundant as each side typically controls their own pawns.\n\nSo compiling this, I can list \"Black Sicilian Defense\" where black takes e4-e5 initially, and \"White Sicilian Defense\" where white does the same. Other variations might include different openings after e4-e5, like moving pawns on d6 or d7, but those seem less about variations.\n\nTherefore, summarizing, the primary variation from the Sicilian is when a player takes the initial pawn advance on e4-e5.\n</think>\n\nBlack Sicilian Defense  \nWhite Sicilian Defense"

Now, cities named after apostles would be places where someone's name is placed on their grave or in a public record related to those historical figures.\n\nI remember hearing about St. Paul the Apostle. He was a key figure in the Roman Empire, so it makes sense that his city would be named after him. I'm pretty sure it's called “St. Paul, St. Louis” or something similar. But wait, isn't it \"St. Paul\" more commonly used? I think in the Bible context, it might be referred to as \"St. Louis\" because of its location in the United States, specifically in Missouri.\n\nNext up is St. James the Apostle, who wrote thecanonical epistles in the Bible. I believe his city is also named after him, so that should be another one. It's probably called \"St. James.\" But where exactly? I think it's in Michigan or some part of the Midwest. Maybe something like \"St. James, St. Hancock\" to indicate its location.\n\nThen there's St. Peter the Apostle, who is also known as the \" apostle Peter,\" which has a Latin name. His city would be called \"St. Peter.\" Now, where is that? I think it's in California or the United States, probably on the Pacific coast. So maybe \"St. Peter\" with a location suffix.\n\nI'm not sure about any other apostles mentioned frequently enough to have their cities named after them. For example, St. Paul the Apostle comes to mind more often because he was central to the early Christian church and had a significant impact in the Roman Empire. Others like St. James and St. Peter also stand out due to their prominence in religious texts.\n\nI should double-check if these names are accurate. \"St. Paul\" is definitely named after him, but it's more commonly referred to as such because of its location. \"St. James\" would be the city where his epistles were written. And \"St. Peter\" would be his actual city or a nearby one where he was called by that name.\n\nAre there any other cities with apostle names? I'm not sure, but given the information and common usage, these three seem to be the most prominent ones. Maybe checking some historical references or religious texts could confirm their exact locations, but based on what I know, these are the main ones.\n</think>\n\nSt. Paul, St. Louis",

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out which civil wars started in the nineteenth century and provide a detailed answer without using abbreviations. Let's see, what's considered a civil war during that time.\n\nFirst, I remember that the Civil War is one of the most famous ones, but it was between slavery and free states. That started around 1860-1865 in the United States. So that fits into the nineteenth century.\n\nThen, there are other civil wars with significant historical events. Maybe in Europe? I think of something like the Spanish Civil War starting in the mid-17th century, which is before the nineteenth century. But wait, was that a civil war? I believe it was more about political issues between different factions. So that wouldn't count.\n\nIn Latin America, I remember there's a war around 1850s. That might be relevant here. The Revolutions of 1857 are more about the Spanish-American War and the spread of democracy. Not civil war.\n\nI also recall the Spanish Civil War in the 17th century was between the Spanish colonies and the Portuguese, so no Civil War that time.\n\nIn Central Asia, there's a conflict around 1630s. The Taurine Wars were a significant event, but I'm not sure if they're considered a civil war. They were more about territorial disputes rather than slavery issues.\n\nWait, the Soviet Civil War in the early 20th century (which is earlier than the nineteenth century) might have happened around 1925-1936. But that's outside the timeframe we're looking for. So maybe not relevant.\n\nAlso, the Civil War in Latin America after the Spanish Revolution, but again, that was before the nineteenth century.\n\nI think I'm stuck between the United States and other regions, especially within North America. The main civil war in the US during the 19th century is definitely the Civil War of 1860-1865. Maybe there are other ones? Let me check quickly.\n\nI can't recall any other major civil wars with significant historical events starting in the 19th century outside of the American Civil War. So perhaps only that one?\n\nBut wait, maybe there's something like the U.S. Civil War which covers a broader period, but it was more about slavery than civil war. So probably not.\n\nAlso, the U.S. Civil War started around 1860-1865 in the American context. There's another Civil War that happened in Russia starting in 1784, which is much earlier. So no.\n\nSo I think the main civil war during the 19th century is the one between Fugitive slaveholders and free states, primarily the United States.\n</think>\n\nUnited States of America"

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which civil wars took place in South America. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the regions, but I can start by thinking about the major countries there and the events that happened then.\n\nFirst, I know that Brazil is a big part of South America. I remember something about the War of the Spanish Confrontation or the Ciaconesque War in the 16th century. That was when the Portuguese took over Brazil from the Spanish via Rio de Janeiro. That's one civil war.\n\nMoving on to Peru, I think there was a civil war too, probably starting in the 19th century. It was about the independence of the Peruvian people and some conflicts with the Spanish colonial government. Maybe it lasted until the early 20th century?\n\nThen there's Chile. I'm not as sure about that one. Perhaps it was a series of wars or conflicts involving Chilean groups fighting against the Spanish and the Portuguese. I think it might have had multiple incidents, but I don't recall any major civil wars. Maybe it's a bit more regional or local.\n\nI should also consider other countries in South America. Maybe there were conflicts in Argentina or Colombia? But wait, I'm not too sure about Argentina, so maybe that one isn't as prominent. Similarly for Colombia, I think it was more of an armed conflict rather than a civil war, but I might be wrong.\n\nSo putting this together, the main ones are Brazil with the 16th-century War of the Spanish Confrontation, Peru's 19th-century civil war over independence, and Chile which involved regional conflicts. The rest either didn't have major civil wars or were more complicated in other ways.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any others. Maybe it's worth checking recent events, but I think the primary ones are those three. So, to list them: Brazil (16th century), Peru (19th century), Chile (various conflicts). That seems comprehensive for South America.\n</think>\n\nBrazil  \nPeru  \nChile  \n\nNo other civil wars were prominent in South America."

I don't recall him having played for clubs like Chelsea or Liverpool, so maybe not. He joined Deportivo de La Liga de España in 2004 and stayed there until 2015. \n\nAfter that period, he moved to Borussia Mönchengladbach, which is a German club.

Green comes to mind for spinach. Blue might be related to carrots or blueberries? Yellow sounds familiar from tomatoes.\n\nWait, what about other fruits? Peaches and pears are yellow too. Maybe some others like cherries or strawberries have shades named after them. Also, colors in sports like the color of a soccer ball is black. I remember hearing about purple in the context of limes. Pink might be for watermelon. Brown could be related to potatoes.\n\nI'm not sure if there are other fruits with names based on colors. Maybe some less common ones?

Then there's ICML, which is more general but very relevant since it focuses on ML. CVPR is another one; they focus on computer vision, but their conferences often overlap with ML topics too.\n\nICAI is also important because it covers AI and machine learning in healthcare. I remember that happening a few times each year. NeurIPS is kind of a more specialized conference, so it's probably worth including there as well. \n\nThe Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML) seems to be another key event for young researchers.

MLSS is a specialized conference focused on deep learning and its applications in finance, so that's definitely relevant.\n\nI'm pretty sure NeurIPS is the number one in the field globally.

Let's start by recalling who the Turing Awards are given to. The Turing Award is a prestigious prize in computer science, often awarded every year at a symposium called the ACM Turing Centennial Conference or sometimes as an invited conference.\n\nThe first Turing Award winner was Stephen A. Cook from 1966. I remember he organized the First ACM-SIAM Symposia on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (USACM) in 1970. That seems right because it's a significant event that likely included multiple distinguished speakers, which might have been hosted by Turing Award winners.\n\nNext up is Donald Knuth. He won the award in 2011. I'm pretty sure he organized the Turing Centennial Conference, which would be the 30th annual conference since the award started in 1986. This would make it a major event, so hosting it makes sense.\n\nThen there's Robert G. Sacks. He received the Turing Award in 2019. I believe he was involved in organizing the Turing Centennial Conference again, or maybe it was another one of his previous ones. It's worth noting that after the first conference by Cook and Knuth, Sacks organized a symposium on big data at the SIAM/ACM meeting.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Sacks was also organizing the Turing Centennial, so maybe he did more than just once? Let me check. Oh, right, he organized both the 1986 and 2019 conferences as part of his work on big data at SIAM/ACM in 2021. So after hosting in 1986, he again hosted in 2019.\n\nIs that all? I think so. There's no third one mentioned here. It seems like Cook and Knuth each organized their own Turing conferences once, and Sacks organized the one for big data twice. That gives us a comprehensive list with the number of times each Turing Award winner hosted these conferences.\n</think>\n\nThe following Turing Award winners have been involved in hosting several conferences, as detailed below:\n\n1. Stephen A. Cook (1966): Organized the First ACM-SIAM Symposia on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science (USACM) in 1970.\n2. Donald Knuth (2011): Hosted the Turing Centennial Conference, which is the 30th annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.\n3. Robert G.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which countries are governed by a monarchy system. Let's start by thinking about what a monarchy is like. It's a form of government where power is held by one or a few planetary monarchs who have supreme authority over the kingdom.\n\nI remember that the United States is the only country in the world without a parliamentary system. That makes sense because of their large population and diverse history, so they've followed a constitutional monarchy since ancient times but then moved to something more formal with the Declaration of Independence.\n\nNow, other countries... How about Canada? I think Canada has a constitutional monarchy too, especially after the French and Indian War when they shifted from confessional to parliamentary form. That would make sense because it's a large country with diverse regions that need a clear political system.\n\nWhat about some other places like Australia or New Zealand? They also probably have constitutional monarchies, maybe something more than just a monarchy but perhaps with a bit of parliamentary support as well.\n\nI don't recall many countries officially having a monarchy. Others might follow other forms like republics or navies. For example, Spain used to have navies led by the Spanish Royal Family until it was integrated into a republic under Carlos V in 1632. So that's more of a republic but still has some royal backing.\n\nHow about India? They have both constitutional monarchies and republics, with recent changes bringing them closer to modern governance. There might be variations based on recent events like the 2020 pandemic or other political shifts.\n\nIs there any country beyond these that I'm missing? Maybe looking into less obvious countries like some in Africa or parts of Europe not as commonly associated. But generally, it's either a monarchy with parliamentary system or a republic, though often both systems coexist.\n\nI think the key is to focus on the official status of the government type rather than specific historical periods. So I should list the ones that have been recognized as having such monarchies without being partaking in parliament.\n</think>\n\nUnited States of America  \nCanada of Canada (constitutional Monarchy)  \nAustralia (constitutional Monarchy)  \nNew Zealand ( Constitutional Monarchy )  \nUnited Kingdom (Royal Family, but now a republic with parliamentary support since the 1980s)  \nIndonesia ( constitutional Monarchy after the monarchy was dissolved in 2020 due to COVID-19)  \nIndia (Reforms led by the Indian Royal Family have seen it transition towards modern governance)  \nSpain (Navies led by the Spanish Royal Family until 1632 when it became a republic)  \nGreece (Historically, but now a republic with parliamentary support)"

Croatia comes next; it's located in the eastern Balkans, specifically in the Donbizi Peninsula. Cyprus was once part of Greece but has been an independent state since 2003.\n\nNorth Macedonia is another key country here, especially because it's known for its capital, Skopje, which is central to the North Macedonian people's identity and culture. The People's Republic of China shares borders with Albania and is considered part of the Balkan region due to its historical connection.\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina was once a member, but now it's recognized as an independent state.

For example, Sweden is connected to a plant—green spruce trees. That makes sense because they're related to nature. So Sweden fits this category.\n\nThen there's Germany, which comes to mind with bluebells in the Rhine River. That’s pretty much a plant name for their flag colors. So Germany is another one that comes from plants.\n\nI also remember that Japan has something to do with water and mountains. The country is often associated with Mount Fuji. So Japan would definitely be on this list.\n\nLooking further, I think Russia is linked to snow. The Red Square in Moscow stands out as a well-known place for skiing and mountain biking. That's another plant name origin.\n\nI'm trying to remember other names that come from plants. Maybe Argentina? They have national flags with flowers like the Mustang and Magallanes.

Also, Canada's maple tree is a big part of their culture.

Wait, no, actually, Kyoto is more commonly known. Maybe I should double-check that.\n\nI think the United States has two capitals: Washington D.C. and DC, which is redundant now. Then there are countries like Ireland with multiple spellings, such as Limerick and Maybecroft, and perhaps Belgium's Brussels. Canada has Hamilton as a capital, but I believe there's also another one too.\n\nI should list each country that does have multiple capitals clearly so the user knows exactly which ones. Maybe I can structure it by country names with their capitals mentioned where appropriate. Also, some countries might not have established capitals, though that seems less likely. \n\nWait, does any country actually have more than two? Let me check. For instance, Canada's second capital is Hamilton, and then there are others like Stephenton or...\nNo, I think Canada only has Hamilton as the main one now. Ireland's first capital is Limerick, and they might have another in Limerick again. Belgium has Brussels as well.\n\nI should make sure each country is correctly capitalized and spelled out without any abbreviations. Also, avoid using numbers or special symbols except for when specifying a particular spelling like Star Wars V for the fifth edition of Star Wars. \n\nPutting it all together, I'll list each country with their respective capitals where applicable.

        "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking which countries drive on the left. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because I know most of the world drives are on the right side, but maybe there are exceptions.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides: east-west and north-south. People might get confused between these directions. Maybe some countries have become more west-oriented recently.\n\nI remember that in North America, the U.S., Canada, and Mexico are mostly west-left. But I'm not sure about the rest of the country. Maybe there are a few others like Germany or Japan? Wait, no, those are north-left. So probably only the US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and maybe some African countries?\n\nI should think about each one. The U.S., Canada, Mexico — definitely west-left. Then Australia is more east-west but still left-facing. New Zealand is pretty much the same as Australia in this context. Also, Japan is north-left overall.\n\nWait, what about Canada? Canada's driving style can be both left and right, but it's more consistent towards the west side. I think they have a reputation for being more left-moving.\n\nSo putting it all together: US, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Japan.

Let's start by thinking about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that most countries have their national leaders elected through elections, and traditionally, leadership positions are held by male leaders. But there might be exceptions where the leader is women. I remember that in some cases, like Japan, the Prime Minister was often a woman. That's a good example.\n\nI should consider countries with female leaders both in government roles and political roles. For instance, the UK had the Queen as head of state since Queen Elizabeth II served in her position until 2000. Also, Australia has the Prime Minister; sometimes women take on that role under various names like Jacinda Ardern or Naniwahini.\n\nLooking at other countries: Canada had a female leader for a time with Jean Chrétien until she was removed by the government around 1978. India has several female leaders, including the Union of India's Prime Minister, the Chief Executive, and others like K herself in recent times. India has had women as Prime Minister, President, and Chief Executive.\n\nI should include some countries where there hasn't been a gender-neutral head of state for a long time or where it's still debated. For example, Sweden and Norway have been using men for several generations now, so I guess they don't have a female head of state in those cases. Also, the Netherlands used a male leader, but maybe they've had some female ones recently.\n\nI also need to consider if there are any countries with less traditional leadership roles. Like, are there countries where the Prime Minister or similar roles are held by women sometimes? For example, Australia and Canada might have instances, but I think those are already covered.\n\nPutting it all together, I can list the countries that have a female head of state based on elections, political roles, and traditional leadership. I'll make sure to include examples like Japan for Prime Minister, Australia with Queen and Prime Minister, UK with Queen, Canada with Jacinda, India with K herself, and mention Sweden/Norway where it's not been used much.\n\nI should also consider if there are any modern countries with a female leader. Maybe some Indian states or regions have had women in the leadership role recently? I'm not sure about that, but I'll stick to established examples.\n\nSo, compiling all this information into a list would give me an exhaustive answer without making it too long or confusing.\n</think>\n\nUnited States of America (USA), United Kingdom, UK Queen Elizabeth II, Japan, Prime Minister: Jacinda Ardern, India, Indian Union of India's Prime Minister, Union of India's Chief Executive, K, Canada, Jacinda Chrétien, Australia, Queen (Prime Minister), Sweden/Norway."

That's a key point. Also, I believe the European Union is involved in some diplomatic ties here. Maybe the European Union and its member states.\n\nThen there's Australia.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which countries have Islam as their official religion. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Islam is one of the major religions in the world. But it's not like all religions are equally recognized or implemented across different cultures and regions. Each country has its own version of Islam based on its history, traditions, and political context.\n\nI remember that a few countries have their own form of Islam despite their names. For example, the Islamic Courts Movement is an organization in Iran that promotes Islam as a secular religion. That's one off the list because it seems to be more of an anti-religious movement rather than having Islam as the official religion.\n\nNext, I think about Turkey. There's something called \"Turkish fundamentalism,\" which interprets Islam for religious purposes and teaches certain teachings in schools. This is still widely used in Turkey, so that's another country on the list even though it doesn't strictly follow all of Islam.\n\nI also recall that Iran follows a different form of Islam known as Farsi, which includes concepts like chivalry. So, while people in Iran might have a traditional understanding of Islam, it's not the official religion from a secular perspective.\n\nIn terms of other countries, I'm trying to remember if there are any others beyond Turkey and Iran. I think China also has its own version of Islam called Mesoastan Islam or Confucianism. Similarly, Thailand might have their own religious practices under the framework of Buddhism. So including these as separate entities.\n\nLet me see, are there any other regions? Japan has a traditional sense of duty towards rice and labor. India has various religious communities, though it's more about spirituality than strict adherents to one religion. South Africa has different religious practices depending on the culture and history, like the Kamaish people.\n\nSo compiling this, the countries with Islam as their official religion are Turkey, Iran, China (China), Thailand, Japan, India (indians), South Africa, and South Korea (Korea). That's a comprehensive list without including any non-Official religions or those that don't strictly follow Islamic principles.\n</think>\n\n turkey",

The last one was in 2019 at a venue in India. Before that, I recall that South Africa won the 2003 World Cup, so that's definitely included.\n\nThen there's India.

Let's start by recalling what I know about FIFA and their history.\n\nFirst, I remember that the FIFA World Cup is a men's world cup, held every four years under the FIFA numbering system. It's one of the most prestigious football competitions globally.\n\nI think it starts with the first World Cup in 1934 when Brazil won it against France. That was the classic World Cup with a lot of historical significance because Brazil became a global powerhouse after that victory. So Brazil definitely made the list.\n\nNext, there were some major tournaments over the years. For instance, the 2018 World Cup was held in Russia, and I believe Russia won it. Then, in 2022, a virtual match between Germany and Switzerland took place, but Switzerland still stayed on the list because they played a significant role.\n\nThe tournament in 2026 is scheduled for Brazil again, so that adds to their ongoing participation. Let me make sure I have all the correct years. From what I can remember, after 1934, the winners were Brazil (1934), France (1958), Germany (1974), France again (1994), Italy (2008), Brazil again (2014), Germany (2018), Switzerland (2022), and Brazil once more in 2026.\n\nWait, I should double-check the years to ensure accuracy. Also, I might have missed some countries or included others who didn't win. Let me think about other tournaments. The 2002 World Cup was in Mexico, so Mexico won that as well. So that's another entry.\n\nI'm pretty sure the other countries were part of FIFA's history before 2014 and then after 2018. I don't recall any more recent winners beyond 2026. So compiling this list should include Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Switzerland, and perhaps some others from earlier tournaments.\n\nWait a minute, was there a World Cup in 2014? Oh yes, the 2014 FIFA World Cup was held in Brazil as well, with Brazil winning. So that's an additional entry before 2018.\n\nI think that covers all the countries that have won the FIFA World Cup from what I can recall. Let me make sure there are no other significant tournaments after 2026. From my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the next one would be virtual in 2026, then perhaps in 2034 or 2038.\n\nSo, compiling this into a list: Brazil (1934), France (1958), Germany (1974), Italy (1994), Mexico (2002), Switzerland (2022), and Brazil again (2026).

It's a day where the UK and France honor their soldiers who have lost their lives in World War 2. That makes sense because it commemorates significant bravery during that time.\n\nFirst, I should identify all the major European countries involved. The UK is already part of this list since they're the primary country. Next, France comes to mind as a direct participant. Are there any other big powers? I'm not sure if Germany or another country is widely celebrated in the same way. Maybe Italy or Spain?

Germany isn't given a special status like they often do with their other nations.

Also, Taiwan again was part of China after 1971, so maybe they dissolved as well?\n\nI also recall something about the Russian Empire. They merged with another empire or had a foreign policy shift.

He spent over 30 years, so it's possible he might have had pizza as his last meal. But wait, I should check if there were others with that exact situation.\n\nI recall that in the early years, prisoners on death row sometimes had their last meals at bars or other facilities instead of directly on the death row. For example, before Simpson, some prisoners had lunch at bars like The Old Town in London or similar places. But pizza specifically might have been less common back then because many were working or traveling.\n\nAnother thought: I think there was a case where a prisoner with a specific ID, maybe #564798, had his last meal on the run after serving a life sentence. That sounds familiar. They served him pizza and then released him on death row. So that fits the criteria.\n\nI should verify if this is the only one or if there are others.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which drugs are contraindicated for treating atrial fibrillation when someone is already taking lovastatin. Hmm, I remember that both atrial fibrillation and lovastatin are conditions related to heart rhythm disorders.\n\nAtriaclfibration is a common condition, especially in patients with heart disease or certain risk factors like obesity. Lovastatin is an ACE inhibitors, which are used to lower blood pressure and manage heart conditions by blocking the ACE enzymes that reduce blood pressure. These drugs work by relaxing the heart muscle, which helps with reducing atrial rhythm disorders.\n\nNow, when combining these two, I'm thinking about any contraindications. Maybe certain statins or other medications could interact negatively with lovastatin. Wait, isn't there a risk of drug interactions? I've heard that some drugs can affect ACE inhibitor therapy. For example, maybe diuretics could cause side effects because they increase fluid retention and may interfere with the body's ability to take in the medication.\n\nOr perhaps beta-blockers or other medications might interact with the relaxant effects of lovastatin. I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps statins themselves cannot be used if someone is on a heart transplant. I think some people have heart conditions where receiving a new organ replacement puts them at high risk for atrial fibrillation and their medications should be adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, another possibility: there might be an interaction between certain statins with ACE inhibitors. For instance, maybe a diuretic like hydrocortisone or a substance to increase fluid retention (like bupropion). I'm not sure about all the interactions though. Some people might take other ACE inhibitor analogues or different ACE inhibitors and face issues.\n\nI should also consider if any medications specifically target the heart rhythm in a way that could interfere with lovastatin's effectiveness. Maybe some blood pressure lowering drugs interact with the relaxant medications.\n\nSo, putting it together, possible contraindications include statins, diuretics, and beta-blockers. Wait, but I'm not sure if all of these are completely off for lovastatin users. It might depend on individual responses and how the medications affect blood pressure or fluid balance.\n\nAnother point is that some patients with atrial fibrillation may not respond well to certain statins, but since they're already taking one, maybe others can be used. But I'm not confident about this part.\n\nOverall, it's a bit unclear without more specific information on all the possible interactions. Maybe the main ones are related to blood pressure control or fluid retention. So, including those in my answer seems reasonable.\n</think>",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which Ethiopian political parties were founded since 2000. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about Ethiopia and its political landscape.\n\nI remember that Ethiopia is a relatively modern country with a history in politics. I think they had several major parties during the 1990s and early 2000s. Wait, was there a notable party after the 2003 elections? Oh right, in 2003, there were two significant events: the ruling Shabaat Party (Shabaat) came into power and the Free Democratic Party (FDP) also started forming. Both parties have had significant influence.\n\nI wonder if there are any other notable political entities that became prominent after that period. I know Ethiopia is a country of several states, so maybe each state has its own political parties or organizations. Let me think... There's the Southern People's Party (SPP) which was established in 1998, but that's before 2000. Then after Shabaat and FDP, I believe there were more parties. Maybe the National Front for Unity (NFU) also came into play around that time.\n\nWait, I'm trying to remember if there were any others. Oh yes, the Ethiopia People's Congress Party (EPCP), which was formed in 2013. That seems like another significant party after 2000. So putting it all together, from 2000 onwards, the major parties were Shabaat, FDP, SPP, NFU, and EPCP.\n\nI should check if there are any other parties that became prominent between 2000 and now. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me see... I think those five cover a lot of areas in Ethiopia's political landscape. They've been influential in different regions and ideologies, like Shabaat for economic stability, NFU for development, SPP for regional unity, and EPCP for political reforms.\n\nI don't recall any other significant parties from 2000 onwards, so I think these five are the main ones.\n</think>\n\nUnited States of America, United States of America (Shabaat Party), United States of America (FDP), United States of America (Southern People's Party), United States of America (National Front for Unity), United States of America (Ethiopia People's Congress Party)."

        "<think>\nAlright, so I've got this question: \"Which football midfielders born in Senegal have played for France?\" Hmm, let's break it down. I need to find players who were born in Senegal and are from France.\n\nFirst, I should think about the most famous French midfielders, maybe? Maybe someone like Sissi or Sissie. Oh wait, I know Sissi was born in Senegal, right? He's really popular. And he played for Lille, which isn't a French club, but I think they did sign him up. So that fits the criteria.\n\nThen there's Sissie 250, another name I've heard before. That's a sequel to Sissi, probably from the same time period and from Lille. That makes sense because it would naturally be on French teams if he played for them.\n\nI should make sure these names are spelled correctly in English without any abbreviations or acronyms, as per the instructions. Also, since both players were born in Senegal, they fit the \"born in Senegal\" part. They are also playing for France, so that's covered.\n\nI don't think there are others like that off the top of my head. I'll go with these two as the answer.\n</think>\n\nSissi and Sissie 250"

Well, first off, I'm pretty sure Senegal is part of West Africa, right? So that makes sense as a country with football teams.\n\nI remember seeing some players from Senegal before; maybe some African brothers or sisters who are big on football. Let me think... Oh, there's Charles Adouane and Fodé Gning Modinbo. I've heard their names a lot in the context of African football. They were really good at playing for various teams.\n\nNow, about France specifically. I know some French footballers from Senegal, like Paul Pogba or Thierry Henry, but those are players who played for Paris Saint-Germain and maybe others. They didn't play for France in the modern sense because they left after a few years. So that might be why it's tricky to find out if they've ever been a player for France.\n\nWait, is there any other Senegalese footballer I should consider? Maybe some younger players or those who were part of teams that merged with French clubs in the past. But since we're talking about players born in Senegal, it might be more limited to the current national team and some youth teams they've been part of.\n\nI'm trying to remember if any major French footballers have roots in Senegal. I don't think so because most of them were already established before the country gained recognition as a football powerhouse. So maybe there aren't many players from Senegalese who played for France right now.\n\nSo putting this together, it seems like there are no current or notable players from Senegal who have played for France. The only people I know from Senegal in football are those who left after they were too old to stay on forever. Therefore, the answer is that no one born in Senegal has currently played for France.\n</think>\n\nno answer"

I think he died from heart failure and other complications, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact year.\n\nNext up is Barack Obama. He was in the White House for a few years before dying. I believe he passed away after some time, around 2019 or 2020? That's good to know. Donald Trump didn't live long enough for COVID-19 complications because he died in 2011 from another condition. So he's out of the list.\n\nI also remember that Joe Biden was in the White House but passed away after health issues, around 2024 or so. That leaves a couple other leaders like George W.

This included awarding them the title of Honored Mayor, which came after they met certain criteria, like community service or leadership. \n\nNow, thinking about the candidates I've heard about: Mike deMark is a mayor from San Francisco.

But in terms of directing, it's not straightforward. Let me think... Siblings might have worked together or independently on similar projects, but horror isn't typically associated with that.\n\nI remember that some siblings were involved in film during different eras. For example, maybe Frank Darabont and Frank Darabont? I'm not sure if they directed anything together. Then there's John Zane's work. He wrote a lot of horror films but didn't have a single directing career. Maybe he worked with others who had siblings.\n\nI also remember that some directors were married to women or had children, which might affect their choices regarding directing. I'm not sure about specific examples. Maybe looking into the 20th century since then? There are titles like \"The Omen\" directed by Frank Darabont, but did his other film have a sibling involved?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in the early 1930s or so when siblings were common in film projects, but I can't recall any specific horror films. It's possible that there aren't many examples of this particular category.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the answer might be that there are no well-documented horror movies where siblings were involved as directors.

That one deals with themes of paranoia, which ties into Dick's earlier work on stories about paranoia. So that's probably a big one.\n\nThen there's \"The Man Who Counted,\" released in 1985. I'm pretty sure it's based on a book he wrote called \"Poland: A Man at the Threshold of History.\" That seems right, so that should be another movie from Dick.\n\nWhat about \"A Time Machine\" from 1946? I think it's based on a novel by him too, called \"The Time Traveler’s Wife.\" That would make sense because time travel is a big theme in his work.\n\nI also remember \"The New Yrhiel,\" which was 1970. It sounds like it's from a Dick story about the Yrhiel, so that's another one.\n\nThen there's \"Dune\" released in 1994. I'm pretty sure he wrote a book called \"The Dune\" before that, and that influenced the movie. That would definitely be on the list.\n\nWait, what about other films? Oh, \"21\", which was 1985.

It might be rated M or G because of its emotional content, but since it's live-action, perhaps R if there are some warnings.\n\n\"The Girl with All the Gifts\" is a movie about siblings and relationships, which could involve a lot of family drama. I think this is an MPAA-R movie because it has mature themes.\n\n\"Out of My World\" is another animated film set in China and involves a girl's journey into foreign culture. The humor here might be light-hearted but still not PG-13 or higher, so maybe R rating-wise.\n\n\"Happy Ending\" is a feature film about a couple trying to find their way back to the past. It's known for its emotional depth and might be rated G because it has intense romantic themes.\n\n\"Beach Boys\" is an animated movie based on the beach band, directed by Zhao. The content could involve some adult themes, so maybe R rating-wise if there are warnings about age or explicit content.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure about any others, but considering the movies listed, these seem to be all the ones I can think of directed by Zhao that aren't rated R in MPAA terms.\n</think>\n\nThe movies directed by Chloé Zhao that do not have an MPAA rating of R include:\n\n- **Bleu**: G or R (live-action with some mature content)\n- **The Girl with All the Gifts**: R (based on a movie but has PG-13 warnings)\n- **Dust in the Wind**: G or R\n- **Sunrise Road**: M or G\n- **Out of My World**: R\n- **Happy Ending**: G\n- **Beach Boys**: R\n\nThese films are all based on live-action works and contain mature themes, so their MPAA ratings may be lower than what a purely fictional film might have."

Maybe it's better to list some more systematically.\n\nWait, I think I have a few names: Søren Schuh (Danish), Peter Dyck (Norwegian), Björk (Swedish), David Marlowe ( Danish), Matti Väinänen (Finnish). Or perhaps I'm missing someone. Let me double-check.\n\nI also remember someone from Denmark named Christian Højlund, and maybe a Swedish musician like Matti Bäckman. Alternatively, someone from Finland could be Peter Jonsson or something else. Wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe it's better to list known Nordic musicians regardless of exact country origins.\n\nWait, perhaps the user expects the most common ones. Let me think: Søren Schuh (Danish), David Marlowe ( Danish), Björk (Swedish), Peter Jonsson (Swedish or Viking), Matti Väinänen (Finnish), and maybe someone from Denmark like Christian Højlund. Additionally, perhaps there are others like Christian Jentsch or Mikael Söderberg.\n\nWait, I'm not sure about all the details here. It's possible that some of these names might be inaccurately attributed. To get a comprehensive list without relying on prior knowledge, it might be better to refer to general knowledge. But since the user asked for a specific answer, perhaps they have in mind a certain number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The main Nordic countries are Denmark, Norway, and Finland. So musicians from these regions would include people like Søren Schuh, Björk, David Marlowe, etc., even if their country isn't exactly those names.\n\nI think I should compile a list of known Nordic musicians, listing each with their full name and country. Let me try to structure this properly.\n\nFirst, Søren Schuh from Denmark. Then, Björk from Sweden, who's quite famous in the jazz world. David Marlowe is also Danish but might be from another region. Maybe someone else like Anthea Heston from England, but perhaps that's European. Alternatively, maybe someone from Denmark named Christian Højlund.\n\nThen, Matti Väinänen from Finland. Peter Jonsson from Sweden. Maybe someone like Mikael Söderberg from Finland as well. Perhaps also a Swedish musician like Matti Bäckman. Additionally, maybe someone from Denmark called Christian Jentsch or Mikkel Stordal.\n\nWait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to list as many as I can confidently say are Nordic:\n\n1. Søren Schuh - Denmark\n2. Björk - Sweden\n3. David Marlowe - Denmark (or another country)\n4. Anthea Heston - England, but perhaps from a European region.\n5. Mikkel Söderberg - Finland\n6. Peter Jonsson - Sweden\n7. Mikkel Stordal - Denmark\n8. Matti Väinänen - Finland\n9. Matti Bäckman - Sweden\n10. Christian Jentsch - Denmark\n11. Christian Højlund - Denmark\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Alternatively, perhaps the user is referring to musicians who have had significant international influence in these regions.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the question might be seeking a list of well-known Nordic musicians, here's another approach: think about the most prominent ones from each region. For example:\n\nNorway-based: Maybe someone like Steffen Böker (but not sure). Denmark: Søren Schuh, David Marlowe, Christian Højlund, Mikkel Stordal, maybe Mikkel Söderberg.\n\nFinland: Matti Väinänen, Mikkel Söderberg, perhaps others. Norway: Peter Jonsson, Steffen Böker? Or maybe someone like Peter Jonsson as well.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the user might have intended to list musicians from the Nordic regions before European integration, but now they're in Western Europe. So maybe including people who were active before.\n\nI think I need to compile a list based on known information without prior knowledge. Let me try to list them:\n\n1. Søren Schuh - Denmark\n2. Björk - Sweden (jazz legend)\n3. David Marlowe - Denmark\n4. Christian Højlund - Denmark\n5. Mikkel Stordal - Denmark\n6. Peter Jonsson - Sweden\n7. Mikkel Söderberg - Finland\n8. Mikel Sand - Sweden\n9. Mikkel Söderberg (again)\n10. Matti Väinänen - Finland\n11. Matti Bäckman - Sweden\n12. Christian Jentsch - Denmark\n\nWait, maybe this is too many. Alternatively, perhaps focusing on the most prominent ones:\n\nSøren Schuh from Denmark.\n\nBjörk from Sweden.\n\nDavid Marlowe from Denmark.\n\nChristian Højlund from Denmark.\n\nMikkel Stordal from Denmark.\n\nPeter Jonsson from Sweden.\n\nMikel Sand from England (though he might be from a European region, but perhaps considered Nordic in some sense).\n\nMatti Väinänen from Finland.\n\nMatti Bäckman from Sweden.\n\nChristian Jentsch from Denmark.\n\nMaybe that's sufficient. Alternatively, including someone from Finland named Mikkel Söderberg.\n\nBut to stay accurate without prior knowledge, I'll list the ones I can recall: Søren Schuh, Björk, David Marlowe, Christian Højlund, Peter Jonsson, Mikel Sand, Matti Väinänen, Mikkel Söderberg, Christian Jentsch.\n\nI think that's a reasonable list, even though some may be slightly off in country references.\n</think>\n\nSøren Schuh",

        "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out which natural languages are not Indo-European. Let's start by recalling what I know about Indo-European languages.\n\nIndo-Europeans are a large family of languages that include many of the world's major languages today, like English, French, German, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese. They're often grouped under a shared root system, especially in terms of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure.\n\nNow, considering other languages from around the world:\n\n1. **Arabic**: I know Arabic is widely used across the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. It's not part of Indo-Europe, but it's an important language for communication with other Indo-European languages like Russian or Chinese.\n\n2. **Assyrian**: The Assyrians are from the ancient Near East, so their language isn't Indo-European either.\n\n3. **Bolshoi Russian (Modern Russian)**: This is a written language spoken in Russia today, but it's derived from the Cyrillic alphabet, which is not part of the Indo-European family. So, Bologrui doesn't fit.\n\n4. **Carpathian languages**: These are various Carpathian Slavic languages spoken in the Carpathian region. They include languages like Polish and Lithuanian. Since they're Slavic, they fall outside Indo-Europe.\n\n5. **Czech**: This is a Germanic language, so it's definitely not part of the Indo-European network.\n\n6. **Dobronetsky (Soviet Union Slavic)**: Similar to Czech but from the Soviet Union. It's another Slavic language that doesn't fit into Indo-Europe.\n\n7. **Estonian**: A Germanic language, like English or Danish, so it's not part of the Indo-European group.\n\n8. **Gibaldin (St. Peterburgian Russian)**: This is a written Russian from St. Petersburg. It uses Cyrillic letters but is derived from Latin, which isn't part of Indo-Europe.\n\n9. **Georgian**: Another Slavic language spoken in Georgia, not part of the Indo-European network.\n\n10. **Goida**: I think Goida is a Yiddish language spoken there, so it's outside Indo-Europe.\n\n11. **Gurman**: The language of the ancient Neanderthals, known as Gurman, isn't Indo-European since it evolved into Modern English.\n\n12. **Kazakh**: Another Slavic language from Central Asia, not part of Indo-Europe.\n\n13. **Russian (Modern)**: Definitely Indo-European, but that's not what the question is about.\n\n14. **Serbojatidze (Soviet Union Slavic)**: Similar to Czech and Dobronetsky, it's Slavic and Germanic.\n\n15. **Serbs**: A Slavic language spoken in Serbia, not Indo-European.\n\n16. **Tatar**: Tatar is a language from Central Asia that's part of the East Slavic group, so it's outside Indo-Europe.\n\n17. **Tagalog**: Tagalog is a language spoken in the Philippines and Taiwan, so it's part of Southeast Asian languages but not Indo-European.\n\nWait, I'm trying to think if there are more beyond what's on my list. Maybe others like Māori from New Zealand or languages from other regions? But they're mostly non-Indo-Europeans. Also, languages that have multiple roots outside the Indo-European system would fall under this category.\n\nSo, compiling all these, the non-Indo-European languages are a lot of Slavic, Carpathian, Georgi, Goida, Kurman, Serbojatidze, Tagalog, and others like CȞka (Czech) or Dobronetsky. The answer should list as many as possible outside the Indo-European network.\n</think>\n\nThe languages that are not Indo-European include Arabic, Assyrian, Bologrui, Carpathian languages, Czech, Dobronetsky, Erdene, Goida, Kurman, Serbojatidze, Tagalog, and Māori.",

Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the 2000 Summer Olympics were held in Sydney, Australia. That gives me a starting point because New Zealand was one of the countries represented there. But when it comes to individual athletes, I'm a bit fuzzy on who from New Zealand participated specifically.\n\nI remember that cyclists like Daniel Calebe are famous for the 1952 Olympics, so maybe he's included here. Then there's Mark Fennell, who won an Olympic gold medal in the 1980s. Oh, and I think Mark Fennell was from New Zealand too. Wait, is there another one? Oh right, there was also a Canadian athlete named Andrew Cullen, but he wasn't from New Zealand. So maybe just Daniel Calebe and Mark Fennell are the ones.\n\nWait, hold on. There might be more.

I think so.\n\nSo putting it together, the New Zealand athletes who participated in the 2000 Summer Olympics were Daniel Calebe and David Worrall.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which non-human animals have been sent into space. Let's start by breaking down what this means. The user is asking for specific animals that are non-humans but have been sent there on a mission. \n\nFirst, I'll consider what \"non-human\" typically refers to. Usually, it includes primates like humans and apes, birds, reptiles, and others from the class Animalia. Now, thinking about missions, some well-known ones involve specific animal groups.\n\nOne major one is the Mars Sample Return and Return mission (MRFR), which landed on Mars in 2010. They sent animals there, including a variety of species like a human, a horse, an elephant, a cheetah, a rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, a kangaroo, and a kangaroo. So that's quite a mix from different genera.\n\nAnother notable mission is the New Horizons mission in 2015. They sent several primates, including apes like chimpanzees, lemurs, and rhesus monkeys, along with birds and other non-humans. This shows that even if the main focus isn't all animals from one class, they've sent various species.\n\nThen there's the Curiosity mission in 2014. They landed on Mars too, but I don't remember specific animals being sent besides maybe a polar bear or something else? Wait, no, Curiosity didn't send any primates. It was more about rocks and dust. So perhaps the main missions are MRFR and New Horizons.\n\nI should also consider other missions that might include animals from different classes but were significant in space exploration. For example, the Cassini mission sent robots like the Perseverance rover to Saturn, which has some species of mammals. But since it's about non-humans, maybe not relevant here.\n\nAnother thought: sometimes missions are based on specific research goals, not necessarily sending animals from a particular class. For instance, the Perseverance rover landed on Mars with various creatures, including a bird, a tortoise, and some invertebrates. But again, it's about robots and other entities, so maybe not the best fit for non-human animals.\n\nI should make sure I'm accurate. Let me check my knowledge: MRFR sent many primates, New Horizons sent several apes too, but Curiosity didn't send any primates. Are there others? Maybe something like the Cassini mission, which had the Perseverance lander and took samples from different species on Mars. But that's about robots and not animals.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of other missions beyond MRFR and New Horizons. There was also the Curiosity landing, which landed on a polar region with a polar bear, but I'm not sure if that's considered a non-human animal. Polar bears are still classified as primates under humans (in some cases). So perhaps it doesn't count.\n\nI think the main ones are MRFR and New Horizons. Are there others? Maybe the Perseverance on Cassini sent a polar熊, but again, if that's considered a non-human animal, then yes. But I'm not sure about the exact classification. If they're classified as primates, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nIn any case, the user wants an exhaustive list of non-human animals sent into space, with each entry specifying which ones and why. So MRFR sent many species from various genera, and New Horizons sent some primates too. Curiosity didn't send any beyond that. \n\nSo putting this together: MRFR sent animals like humans, horses, elephants, rhinos, hippos, et cetera; New Horizons sent apes like chimpanzees, lemurs, rhesus monkeys, etc. Curiosity sent robots or dust and rocks, not animals.\n\nI should make sure to list all the non-human animals from these missions without overlapping other classes. So the answer would include MRFR's species and New Horizons' primates.\n</think>\n\nMRFR (Mars Sample Return and Return) has landed on Mars with a variety of species including humans, horses, elephants, rhinos, hippos, et al., while New Horizons has sent animals like apes, lemurs, rhesus monkeys, etc. Curiosity did not send any primates beyond its initial mission. \n\nAnswer: MRFR and New Horizons.\n\nno answer  \nidk"

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which online streamers studied at the University of Waterloo. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the University of Waterloo is a big name in academia and tech, known for things like the Waterloo Film Festival and co-founding Facebook with Facebook AI. But do they have any famous streamers from there?\n\nWait, I'm trying to think if any prominent online content creators are associated with the university. Maybe I should consider other universities that might influence these streams. But the user specifically asked about University of Waterloo.\n\nLet me start by checking the names of people who study at the university and see if any of them have streamers online. For example, do any top programmers or coders from the university stream a lot? Well, I'm not aware of specific ones, but maybe they do. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother angle: maybe some notable streamers in AI, machine learning, or other tech fields that align with what's taught at the university. Maybe someone who worked on projects related to AI while studying there? I'm not sure if that would make them famous as a streamer online though.\n\nAlso, considering the structure of the question—asking which specific streamers—it might be looking for a list, but since I don't have concrete names or examples, it's tricky. Maybe I should consider if any top universities in tech have known streamers who joined later through their programs.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the answer is that while there aren't many online streamers from the University of Waterloo themselves, some streamers in related fields might gain traction because of their education and experience. But the user specifically asked about the university, so I need to stick to that.\n\nI should also remember not to use abbreviations or acronyms except for \"University\" as a whole word. And if numbers are involved, like Star Wars V, they should be written without any letters next to each other. So if someone is from Canada, it's just 'Canada'.\n\nPutting this together, since I can't find specific names of streamers who studied at the university and have done online work, maybe the answer is that there isn't a comprehensive list or specific information available. But that seems too general—maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user expects me to recognize that while not many are from the University of Waterloo themselves, some do have popular streamers in their field because of their studies and experience. So maybe a response acknowledging that without concrete names but explaining the connection could be acceptable.\n\nBut the question is asking for which streamers studied at the university, so I should provide specific names if possible. Since I can't find any, perhaps it's safer to say that there isn't a list available and instead provide a brief explanation about how the education might influence their streams.\n</think>\n\nThere isn't a comprehensive list of online streamers who specifically studied at the University of Waterloo, but some streamers in related fields may gain traction due to their education.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which people have elements named after them. The user has given some responses already, but they seem a bit conflicting. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I should probably check each of their points one by one. \n\nLooking at the first response: They mention something about the first element of the periodic table being hydrogen and it having an atomic number of 1. That makes sense because elements are numbered based on atomic weight when they were discovered. So that's straightforward.\n\nNext, in the second response, someone is talking about the first five elements (hydrogen to oxygen) as atomic numbers 1 to 5. Wait, but that can't be right because hydrogen has an atomic number of 1, not 0 or anything else. The rest would follow naturally: He is 2, Li 3, Be 4, B 5, and so on. So maybe they're just listing the sequence.\n\nThe third response says elements are named after scientists with atomic numbers 1 to 5. That's interesting because I know some big names in chemistry. For example, Mendeleev was around that time, but he didn't discover them. Similarly, Curie is a scientist who contributed to understanding element qualities. So elements like Helium (He) comes from someone. But wait, helium wasn't discovered until long after his death. Maybe they are referring to the scientists before or during their discoveries.\n\nThe fourth response talks about atomic number 1 being lithium and 20 being calcium. That makes sense because lithium was found in Li torches in 1839 by Newell and Grumman, so it's named after them. Calcium was discovered in the early 19th century using the-method, so someone like Curie or Curie would be the namesake.\n\nIn the fifth response, elements are named after scientists with atomic numbers 1 to 5: Fermi (nuclear physics), Einstein (special relativity), Rutherford (atomic model). Wait, who was who here. Fermi did the golden foil experiment, so that's right. Einstein came out with his theory of relativity, so he's correct there. Rutherford proposed the atomic model. But the fifth is atomic number 5, which would be Boron (B), because earlier in the periodic table. Wait, but the fifth element after hydrogen is helium (He) at Z=2, then lithium (Li) Z=3, Be (Be) Z=4, Boron Z=5. So maybe they're mixing up the order? Or perhaps it's a typo or misunderstanding.\n\nThen the sixth response lists elements by atomic number 1 to 6: Hydrogen through Carbon. That seems correct because carbon was discovered in the early 19th century, so someone like Mendeleev would name it after his synthesis of carbon compounds.\n\nWait, but then the seventh point says each element is named after a famous person with atomic numbers 1-5: Fermi (nuclear physics), Einstein (relativity), Rutherford (atomic model), Curie (element qualities), and anyone else. But who was Curie? She discovered the elements now known as radium and polonium, which were un Discoverable at the time. So maybe someone like Marie Curie is correct there.\n\nThe eighth response lists elements 1-6: Hydrogen to Carbon. That's right because carbon was the first element discovered. Wait, no—hydrogen is 1, then helium as 2, lithium as 3, and so on up to carbon at 6. So maybe that's a stretch because I thought carbon was discovered in late 1848.\n\nWait, but the user might be mixing up elements based on their atomic numbers, not by discovery. So for example, after hydrogen is helium (Z=2), then lithium (3), Be (4), Boron (5), and Carbon (6). So maybe that's a different order than what I know.\n\nThen the ninth response says each element from 1-6 is named after someone with atomic numbers 1-6. Let me think: Fermi for Z=1, Einstein for Z=2, Rutherford for Z=3, who else? Curie (Z=4), then maybe anyone else in that group. But I'm not sure if there's a fifth person with such contributions.\n\nThe tenth response says each element from 1-6 is named after someone with atomic numbers 1-5: Fermi, Einstein, Rutherford, Curie, and someone else? Maybe Pauli? Wait, Paul Dirac didn't have atomic number 6 or 7. So perhaps that's a misstatement.\n\nPutting this all together, I need to list each person corresponding to elements with atomic numbers from 1 onwards. But there might be some inaccuracies here because some discoveries and scientists don't directly correspond. For example, Mendeleev discovered helium around 1860, so he wouldn't name it Helium until later when someone else (like Berthold von Boltzmann) did.\n\nAlso, the last element is undecayed, which might refer to something discovered in the late 20th century. The user hasn't provided a list for that yet.\n\nSo compiling all this into an exhaustive list as per their instructions would require careful consideration of who was when and how each element's name originated.\n</think>\n\nThe elements named after notable people are determined by their atomic number, but some discrepancies arise due to discoveries versus contributions. Here is the exhaustive list:\n\n- Hydrogen: Atomic Number 1 (discovered by Joseph Proude in 1801)\n- Helium: Not directly discovered by someone with atomic number 2; named after Thor und Breit in 1917\n- Lithium: Named after Albert Newell and William Griffiths in 1839\n- Boron: Named after J. J. Thomson in 1897\n- Carbon: Not directly discovered by someone with atomic number 6; named after Ernest Rutherford in 1904\n\nFor the first five elements:\n- Hydrogen (H): Atomic Number 1\n- Helium (He): Atomic Number 2\n- Lithium (Li): Atomic Number 3\n- Be (B): Atomic Number 4\n- Boron (B): Atomic Number 5\n\nEach element's name corresponds to the atomic number of its discoverer, though some discrepancies exist due to discovery timelines and later naming practices."

Fire is definitely 3 or 4 because those are my favorite colors. But then it got more complicated when I heard about the Triforce, which introduced new types for different Pokémon.\n\nI think some of these new types have both fire and bug elements. For example, Gengar is a Bug typesune and has green eyes. So he definitely plays fire in his attacks like the Fire Ball. Then there's Rhydon, another Bug typesune with pink eyes and red hair. He uses his red hair to confuse opponents and might be involved in some fire-based moves too.\n\nAnother one I heard about is Mew two, which has fire red eyes but can use its green arms to attack. That means it's a mix of fire and bug type. Then there's Rok, the Dragon typesune with yellow eyes. He uses his yellow eyes to hit and often deals damage from fire or water effects.\n\nI'm also considering if there are any Pokémon that aren't named but have these abilities. Maybe some rare types?

Those would definitely be fire types but also have the bug aesthetic.\n\nSo putting it all together, these Pokémon are part of the Triforce and feature both fire and bug abilities through their type numbers and unique traits.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which political parties Abraham Lincoln was a member of. Let's start by recalling what I know about him and his time in politics.\n\nFirst off, Abraham Lincoln is considered one of the greatest presidents in American history. He served during two major elections: the 1860 presidential election and the 1876 ob understone election. \n\nI remember that during the 1860 election, he ran for president against John Balmer. I think he won that race. So, Lincoln was a candidate for the presidency in 1860.\n\nNow, moving on to his time in office, which started with the 1876 ob understone election. I believe he ran against Andrew Jackson for vice-presidency. He lost that election, but that doesn't prevent him from being an active member of the party or serving as a candidate. So, he was a member of the Republican Party during that period.\n\nWait, how does that fit in with the broader political landscape? Let me think about the other major parties around that time. The Democratic-Republican Party was prominent at that time. Lincoln was part of that group and likely supported some Democratic candidates.\n\nThere's also the party he ran against during the 1860 election—the Balmer candidate, I believe he was a Republican there too. So, he was in both the Democratic-Republican and Republican parties during his presidency.\n\nI should consider if there were any other political parties involved. After 1876, he became the president of the United States, which was a significant event for the party. However, I'm not sure if he remained part of the political landscape post-presidency, but that's probably beyond the scope here since the question is about his early career.\n\nSo putting it all together: Lincoln was a member of both the Democratic-Republican Party and the Republican Party during his presidency. He ran for president twice, once in 1860 against Balmer and again in 1876 against Andrew Jackson for vice-presidency. There's also the possibility he was part of other parties or groups that supported him during those years.\n\nI don't think he was a member of any other major political parties at that time, so my answer should be the two parties mentioned: Democratic-Republican and Republican.\n</think>\n\nThe political parties Abraham Lincoln was a member of were the Democratic-Republican Party and the Republican Party.",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which polygonal numbers less than 100 are also pronic numbers. Hmm, let's start by breaking down each part.\n\nFirst, what exactly is a pronic number? I think it's called an oblong number or something like that. From what I remember, pronic numbers are the product of two consecutive integers. So, they can be written as n(n+1). For example, 0 is 0*1, 2 is 1*2, 6 is 2*3, and so on. These are also called rectangular numbers because you can arrange them into a rectangle with sides of length n and n+1.\n\nNow, polygonal numbers are numbers that can form a regular polygon when dots are arranged in a certain number pattern. The simplest ones are triangular (triangular numbers), square, pentagonal, etc. So, I need to find numbers less than 100 that are both pronic and polygonal. That means for each pronic number below 100, I have to check if it's also a polygonal number.\n\nLet me list out the pronic numbers first. Starting from n=0:\n\nn=0: 0*1 = 0\nn=1: 1*2 = 2\nn=2: 2*3 =6\nn=3:3*4=12\nn=4:4*5=20\nn=5:5*6=30\nn=6:6*7=42\nn=7:7*8=56\nn=8:8*9=72\nn=9:9*10=90\nn=10:10*11=110 → That's above 100, so stop here.\n\nSo the pronic numbers less than 100 are: 0, 2,6,12,20,30,42,56,72,90. Now I need to check each of these if they are polygonal numbers.\n\nStarting with 0: Well, is zero considered a polygonal number? It's a bit of an edge case because it doesn't form any actual shape as such. Maybe we can include it for now since the problem includes pronic numbers.\n\nNext, 2. Is 2 a polygonal number? Let me think about square numbers: 1,4,9,... No, that's too high. How about triangular? Yes! I remember that 3 is a triangular number (1+2=3), so 6 would be the next. Wait, 2 isn't on the list of triangular numbers. So maybe 2 isn't a polygonal number beyond itself.\n\nWait, no, perhaps squares. 0²=0, 1²=1, 2²=4... Nope, nothing equals 2 there. So I think 2 is not a square or any higher regular polygon's dot arrangement for n>2. Wait, pentagonal numbers? Let me check the formula.\n\nThe formula for k-gonal numbers is given by P(k,n) = [n*(k-2)]/(k-4) + n when k ≠ 4. But maybe it's easier to recall known values. For example:\n\nPentagonal: The sequence starts as 1,5,12,22,... So 12 is pentagonal.\n\nHexagonal numbers start at 0,6,15, etc., so yes, 6 is hexagonal.\n\nHeptagonal: I think the first few are 1,7,18,34... So no 2 there. Octal (octagonal) starts with 1, 10, 27,... Not relevant here.\n\nSo perhaps 2 isn't a polygonal number beyond itself or in another category. Maybe it's just not considered. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me verify each pronic number individually.\n\n0: Probably yes, but not much interest.\n2: Hmm, is there any regular polygon you can arrange 2 dots? A triangle would need at least 3 points. So nope, so 2 isn't a polygonal number beyond itself.\n\n6: Yes, it's both triangular and hexagonal. Triangular because 1+2=3 for n=2 gives 3, but wait 1*2/2 is 1, which is triangle number 1. Wait, no, I think the formula is (n(n+1))/2. So for n=2: 2*3/2 = 3, which is a triangular number. So 6 would be when n=3 because 3*4/2=6.\n\nBut in any case, 6 is both triangular and hexagonal. So yes, it's polygonal.\n\n12: Let me see if it's square? 3²=9, 4²=16. No, so not square. What about pentagonal? Let's think. The formula for k-gonal numbers is [n(n-1)]/2 when k=4 (since P(4,n) = n(n+1)/2). Wait, that can't be right because the triangular number formula is n(n+1)/2. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for pentagonal numbers it's [n(3n-1)]/2. Let me compute:\n\nFor n=1: (3*1 -1)/2 *1 = 1\nn=2: (6-1)/2*2 → Wait, maybe I should look up the formula properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to check for each k. For example, let's see if 12 is a square number? No. Is it triangular? Let me calculate n(n+1)/2 =12 →n² +n -24=0. Discriminant:1 +96=97. So roots are (-1 ±sqrt(97))/2, which isn't integer. So 12 is not triangular. What about square? No.\n\nWhat about pentagonal numbers? The formula for k=5 is [n(n+3)]/2 =12 → n² +3n -24=0. Discriminant:9 +96=105, which isn't a perfect square. So not pentagonal. Maybe hexagonal?\n\nHexagonal numbers are given by (2n²-n). Let me solve for 2n² -n =12 → 2n² -n -12=0. Discriminant:1 +96=97, again not square.\n\nHow about heptagonal? The formula is (5n²-3n)/2. So set equal to 12:\n\n(5n² -3n)/2 =12 →5n² -3n -24=0. Discriminant:9 + 480=489, not a square.\n\nSo maybe 12 isn't any of these. Hmm, or perhaps I missed something. Maybe it's not a polygonal number for higher k? Or perhaps the question allows including 0, which is trivially a polygon but less interesting.\n\nWait, in my initial list of pronic numbers under 100: up to 90. So maybe I should check each one more carefully.\n\nLet me go through them again:\n\n0: Probably included, as per pronic definition. But not much use.\n2: Not clear. Maybe not.\n6: Yes, both triangular and hexagonal.\n12: As checked before, probably not any polygonal beyond itself or in another category.\n20: Let's see if it's square? 4²=16,5²=25, so no. How about pentagonal? Using the formula [n(n+3)]/2=20 → n² +3n -40=0. Discriminant:9 +160=169=13². So roots (-3 ±13)/2. Positive root is (10)/2=5. So yes, P(5,5)= [5*(5+3)]/2=(80)/2=40? Wait no: 5*8/2=20. Yes! So 20 is the fifth pentagonal number.\n\nBut wait, that's the formula for k=6 perhaps? Let me check P(k,n). No, in the pentagonal case, it's k=5. So yes, 20 is both triangular and pentagonal?\n\nWait no: Wait n here refers to the term in the sequence. For example, P(5)=40? Wait no:\n\nWait the formula for polygonal numbers varies based on the type of polygon. Let me clarify.\n\nFor square numbers, it's n².\nTriangular numbers are T(n) = n(n+1)/2.\nPentagonal numbers: P(n) = (3n² -n)/2.\nHexagonal: H(n)=(2n² +n).\nHeptagonal: H(n)= (5n² -3n)/2.\nOctahedral: O(n)= (n(2n-3))/2. Hmm, no.\n\nWait I think for the k-gonal numbers:\n\nP(k, n) = [n((k-2)n - (k-4))]/2.\n\nSo let me compute P(5, n):\n\n[ n*(3n -1) ] / 2 → for n=1:1*2/2=1, which is a corner case. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of known sequences:\n\nLet me list some polygonal numbers beyond what I know and see if any are pronic below 100.\n\nSquare numbers: 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100,... So none above 2 except maybe higher. But 2 isn't in there.\n\nPentagonal:1,5,12,22,35,...\n\nSo 12 is a pentagonal number but not pronic (pronic starts at 0 and then 2,6,...). So 12 isn't a pronic number? Wait no: 12 is the third pentagonal number.\n\nWait I'm getting confused. The pronic numbers are n(n+1) so they start from 0.\n\nBut perhaps some of them also appear in polygonal sequences. Let's take each pronic number less than 100 and check if it appears in any other polygonal sequence (for k ≥3).\n\n0: Yes, as mentioned before.\n2: Is there a polygon where P(k,n)=2? For example, is there an n such that the formula for k-gon gives 2?\n\nFor pentagonal numbers, using P(5,n) = [n*(3n -1)]/2. Let's set this equal to 2:\n\n[n*(3n-1)]/2=2 →n²*(3n-1)=4.\n\nTesting n=1: (1)(2)/2=1*2=2? Wait, no. For n=1: [1*(3*1 -1)]/2 = (2)/2=1→ P(5,1)=1\nFor n=2: (2*(6-1))/2=(10)/2=5→P(5,2)=5\nn=3: 3*(9-1)/2=12/2=6.\nSo nope, none of these give 2. So perhaps 2 isn't a polygonal number beyond itself.\n\nWait but for k=4 (square), let's see if any n makes P(4,n)=2:\n\nP(4,n) =n² →n²=2→n not integer. So no.\n\nHow about square numbers: No, as before. So 0 is okay, others don't seem to fit.\n\n6: Yes, it's triangular (n=3 since 3*4/2=6) and also hexagonal (P(6,1)=6).\n\n12: Let me see if 12 is any polygonal beyond itself. Check k=5:\n\nUsing P(5,n)= [n*(3n-1)]/2 → set to 12.\n\nSolve n²*3 -n =24 → 3n² -n -24=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 288=289=17². So roots (1 ±17)/6.\n\nPositive root: (1+17)/6=18/6=3. So n=3, so P(5,3)= [3*(9-1)]/2=(24)/2=12. So 12 is pentagonal number.\n\nSo yes, it's a polygonal number for k=5 (pentagon).\n\nWait, but the pronic numbers are defined as n(n+1), so 0,2,6, etc., while polygonal includes more shapes like triangles, squares, pentagons, etc. So each pronic number may or may not be a polygon.\n\nSo let's move on to next pronic number:20.\n\nIs 20 a polygonal number? Let me check for k=5 as above: yes, P(5,3)=12, but also perhaps others?\n\nLet me compute if any other polygons include 20. For example, hexagonal numbers are H(n) = (2n² +n). Let's set that equal to 20:\n\n(2n² +n)=20 →2n² +n -20=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 160=161→sqrt≈12.69, not integer. So no solution.\n\nHow about square numbers? n²=20→n≈4.47, not integer.\n\nWhat about heptagonal numbers? P(k=7,n)=(5n² -3n)/2=20 → 5n²-3n -40=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 +800=809→not a square. So no solution.\n\nSo 20 is both triangular and pentagonal but not any other polygonal number.\n\nWait, wait, earlier I saw that P(5, n)=12 when n=3? No, P(5,3)= [3*(9-1)]/2= (24)/2=12. So 12 is a pentagon, but 20 is not part of the pentagonal sequence beyond itself.\n\nSo moving on to 30:\n\nIs 30 a polygonal number?\n\nCheck k=5 first: P(5,n)= [n*(3n-1)]/2 →30. Solve for n:\n\nn²*3 -n =60→3n² -n -60=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 +720=721→ not square. So no.\n\nk=6: H(n)=(2n² +n)=30→2n² +n -30=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 +240=241→not a square. No solution.\n\nk=5: As above, 30 isn't in pentagonal numbers beyond itself.\n\nWhat about k=7?\n\nP(7,n)=(5n²-3n)/2=30 →5n² -3n -60=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 +1200=1209→not square. So no.\n\nk=4: Square numbers, n²=30→n≈5.47, not integer.\n\nSo 30 isn't any polygonal beyond itself or in another category.\n\nNext pronic number:42.\n\nCheck if it's a polygonal number.\n\nk=6 first: H(n)=(2n² +n)=42→2n² +n -42=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 336=337→not square. No solution.\n\nk=5: P(5,n)= [n*(3n-1)]/2 =42 →3n² -n -84=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 +1008=1009→ not square. So no.\n\nWhat about k=7?\n\nP(7,n)=(5n² -3n)/2=42 →5n² -3n -84=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 + 1680=1689→not a perfect square.\n\nk=3? That's triangular numbers, which would require n(n+1)/2=42. So n² +n -84=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 +336=337→ not square. No solution.\n\nSo 42 isn't any polygonal number beyond itself or in another shape except perhaps itself for k=5, but no.\n\nWait, 42 is actually a heptagonal number?\n\nLet me check P(7,n)= (5n² -3n)/2 =42 →5n²-3n -84=0. Discriminant: same as above, not square. So nope.\n\nSo 42 isn't any polygonal number beyond itself or in another category.\n\nNext pronic number:56.\n\nCheck if it's a polygonal number.\n\nk=5: P(5,n)= [n*(3n-1)]/2 →56.\n\nSolve for n:\n\n3n² -n =112→3n² -n -112=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 1344=1345→ not a perfect square. So no solution here.\n\nk=6: H(n)= (2n² +n) =56 →2n² +n -56=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 448=449→sqrt(449)≈21.2, not integer. No solution.\n\nk=7: P(7,n)=(5n²-3n)/2 =56 →5n²-3n -112=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 + 2240=2249→sqrt(2249)=47.43, not integer. No solution.\n\nk=8: Octagonal numbers are a bit tricky. Let me recall the formula for k=8 octagonal numbers: O(n) = (n(2n - 3))/2.\n\nSet this equal to56:\n\n(n(2n-3))/2=56 →n(2n-3)=112→2n² -3n -112=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 + 896=905→sqrt≈30.08, not integer. So no solution.\n\nk=4: Square numbers, n²=56→n≈7.48, nope.\n\nSo 56 isn't any polygonal beyond itself or in another category.\n\nNext pronic number:66 (Wait, the next after 56 is 6*7 + ... wait, the sequence is 0,2,6,12,20,30,42,56,78,... So next is 78? Wait, no. Let me list them:\n\nn:0→0\nn=1→2\nn=2→6\nn=3→12\nn=4→20\nn=5→30\nn=6→42\nn=7→56\nn=8→72 (since 8*9=72)\nSo next after 56 is72.\n\nBut let me just continue:\n\n78: n=11, since 11*12=132? Wait no. Wait wait, pronic numbers are n(n+1). So n=0→0; n=1→2; n=2→6;n=3→12;n=4→20;n=5→30;n=6→42;n=7→56;n=8→72;n=9→90;n=10→110;n=11→132... Wait 7*8=56, so next is 8*9=72. So after 56 comes72.\n\nSo 78: n=11, since11*12=132>78. No, wait pronic numbers are just consecutive integers multiplied by each other. So perhaps I made a mistake in the list.\n\nWait let me recount:\n\nn",
        "P(n)=n*(n+1)\n0 →0\n1→2 (1*2)\n2→6 (2*3)\n3→12 (3*4)\n4→20 (4*5)\n5→30 (5*6)\n6→42 (6*7)\n7→56 (7*8)\n8→72 (8*9)\n9→90 (9*10)\n10→110 (10*11)\n11→132 (11*12)\nSo yeah, after 56 is72.\n\nIs 72 a polygonal number?\n\nCheck for k=5: P(5,n)=[n*(3n-1)]/2 → set to72:\n\n3n² -n =144→3n² -n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 1728=1729. Hmm, sqrt(1729)=approx41.58→ not integer. So no solution here.\n\nk=6:H(n)=(2n² +n) =72 →2n² +n -72=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 576=577→not a perfect square. No solution.\n\nk=7:P(7,n)= (5n²-3n)/2=72 →5n² -3n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 + 2880=2889→sqrt≈53.76, not integer. So no solution.\n\nk=8: Octagonal numbers are given by O(n)= (n*(2n-3))/2. Set equal to72:\n\n(n*(2n-3))/2=72 →n*(2n-3)=144→2n² -3n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 + 1152=1161→sqrt≈34.08, not integer. So no solution.\n\nk=9: Nonagonal numbers have formula P(9,n)=( (n*(n+1)*(2n+1))/6 )? Wait nonagonal number is different. Wait maybe I should look for the general polygonal formula:\n\nP(k, n) = [(n^2)(k - 2) + n(k -4)]/(2)\n\nSo to check if72 is a polygonal number beyond itself.\n\nWait alternatively, perhaps it's better to list which numbers are both pronic and some other k-gonal for higher k.\n\nBut maybe I can just compute for each k from5 upwards whether P(k,n)=72.\n\nk=4: square, n²=72→n≈8.48, not integer.\n\nk=5: pentagonal: [n*(3n -1)]/2=72 →3n² -n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 2*144=289=17².\n\nSo solutions are (1 ±17)/6. Positive solution: (1+17)/6=18/6=3→P(5,3)= [3*(9-1)]/2=24/2=12≠72. So nope.\n\nWait that's odd because P(5,3) is 12, not72. Maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant calculation.\n\nWait solving 3n² -n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant: b²-4ac = (-1)^2 -4*3*(-144)=1 + 1728=1729.\n\nWait what is sqrt(1729)? Let me check. 1729 is the famous taxicab number, it's 12³ +1=10³+9³? Wait 10³+9³=1000+729=1729.\n\nBut regardless, sqrt(1729)=~41.58, so not integer. So no solution for k=5 with P(k,n)=72.\n\nk=6: H(n)=(2n² +n)=72→2n² +n -72=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 576=577. Not square.\n\nk=7:P(7,n)=(5n²-3n)/2 =72 →5n² -3n -144=0.\n\nSolving: discriminant is9 + 2880=2889→sqrt≈53.76, not integer.\n\nk=8:P(8,n)= (n*(2n-3))/2=72→n*(2n-3)=144→2n² -3n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 + 1152=1161→sqrt≈34.08, not integer.\n\nk=9:P(9,n)= [ (n(n+1)(2n-1))/6 ]? Wait maybe I should use the general formula for k-gonal numbers:\n\nP(k, n) = n*( (k-2)*n - (k-4) ) / 2.\n\nSo P(k, n) = [ (k-2)n² - (k-4)n ] / 2.\n\nWe can set this equal to72 and see if there's a solution for some k ≥5 and integer n≥0.\n\nLet me denote equation as:\n\n[ (k-2)n² - (k-4)n ] / 2 =72 →(k-2)n² - (k-4)n -144=0.\n\nSo this is quadratic in n: [ (k-2) )n² - (k-4) n -144 ]=0.\n\nWe can solve for each k:\n\nLet me try k=5:\n\n(k-2)=3; (k-4)=-1. So equation becomes 3n² +n -144=0.\n\nSolving: discriminant=1 + 1728=1729→sqrt≈41.58, not integer.\n\nk=6:\n\n(k-2)=4; (k-4)=2 →equation:4n² -2n -144=0.\n\nDivide by 2:2n² -n -72=0.\n\nDiscriminant:1 + 576=577→sqrt≈24.02, not integer.\n\nk=7:\n\n(k-2)=5; (k-4)=3 →equation:5n² -3n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 + 2880=2889→sqrt≈53.76, nope.\n\nk=8:\n\n(k-2)=6; (k-4)=4→equation:6n² -4n -144=0.\n\nDivide by 2:3n² -2n -72=0.\n\nDiscriminant:4 + 864=868→sqrt≈29.46, not integer.\n\nk=9:\n\n(k-2)=7; (k-4)=5 →equation:7n² -5n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant:25 + 4*7*144=25+4032=4057→sqrt≈63.68, nope.\n\nk=10:\n\n(k-2)=8; (k-4)=6 →equation:8n² -6n -144=0.\n\nDivide by 2:4n² -3n -72=0.\n\nDiscriminant:9 + 1152=1161→sqrt≈34.08, nope.\n\nk=11:\n\n(k-2)=9; (k-4)=7 →equation:9n² -7n -144=0.\n\nDiscriminant:49 + 4*9*144=49+5184=5233→sqrt≈72.35, not integer.\n\nHmm, this is getting tedious, but seems like no solution for k up to at least11.\n\nWait perhaps I should check larger k? But let's think differently: maybe 72 isn't a polygonal number beyond itself, or maybe it is in some higher k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other pronic numbers that are also polygonal. For example, after 56 comes72, but according to my earlier calculation, none of the higher k up to11 seem to yield an integer solution for n.\n\nWait let's check if someone else has done this before or if it's a known sequence. Wait perhaps I should recall that every polygonal number is also a pronic number plus some other terms... Alternatively, maybe 72 isn't part of any known polygonal numbers beyond the initial ones listed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe n(n+1)=P(k,n) can have solutions for higher k and smaller n? Let me try n=8:\n\nn=8: P(k,8)=k*8 + (k-2)*64/2?\n\nWait no, let's use formula for polygonal numbers:\n\nFor a given k-gonal number, the nth term is P(k,n) = [ (k - 2)n² - (k - 4)n ] / 2.\n\nSo for n=8 and some k: P(k,8)=72 →[8(k-2)-8(k-4)]/2 =72.\n\nWait let me compute that:\n\nNumerator:8(k-2) -8(k-4)=8k -16 -8k +32= (8k -8k) + (-16 +32)=0 +16=16.\n\nSo 16/2=8≠72. So n=8 can't give P(k,8)=72 for any k.\n\nWait maybe I did that incorrectly. Wait for n=9:\n\nP(k,9)= [9(k-2) -5*9]/2 →[9k -18 -45]/2 = [9k -63]/2.\n\nSet equal to72→(9k-63)/2=72→9k -63=144→9k=207→k=23. So for k=23, P(23,9)=72?\n\nWait let me compute that:\n\nP(k,n)= [ (23-2)*81 - (23-4)*9 ] / 2 →[21*81 -19*9]/2→[1701 - 171]/2=1530/2=765≠72. So that doesn't work.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake here: For P(k, n)= [ (k-2) *n² - (k-4)*n ] /2 =72.\n\nSo for n=9:\n\n[ (k-2)*81 - (k-4)*9 ] / 2=72 →(k-2)(81) - (k-4)(9)=144 →81(k-2)-9(k-4)=144→81k -162 -9k +36 =144 →72k -126 =144→72k=270→k=3.5, which is not integer.

Hmm. So perhaps there's only some pronic numbers that are also polygonal? Maybe 0,2,12,30,56,... but 72 isn't in that list and can't be expressed as any polygonal number.\n\nWait but wait, 72 is a pronic number itself: n=8→P(8,8)=8*9=72. So it's a pronic number. But since the question was about polygonal numbers beyond those generated by pronic numbers, i.e., looking for numbers that are both pronic and polygonal with higher k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 72 is not part of any known polygonal sequence beyond its own pronic status.\n\nWait maybe I should check some more values. Let me try n=13 again:\n\nP(k,13)= [ (k-2)*169 - (k-4)*13 ] /2 =72 →(169k - 338) - (13k -52)= (169k -13k) + (-338 +52)=156k -286=144→156k=430→k≈2.75, nope.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps 72 is not part of any polygonal numbers beyond itself and the pronic numbers before it.\n\nSo to summarize: The only numbers that are both pronic (n(n+1)) and polygonal with k>=3 sides? Or maybe just some like0,2, etc.\n\nWait but in our initial run, after 56 comes72, which isn't a polygonal number. So perhaps the answer is none, except for0,2, which are both pronic and polygonal (for any k).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check another n:\n\nn=14: P(k,14)= [ (k-2)*196 - (k-4)*14 ] / 2 =72 →(196k -392) - (14k -56)= (196k -14k) + (-392 +56)=182k -336=144→182k=480→k≈2.647, nope.\n\nn=9: P(k,9)= [ (k-2)*81 - (k-4)*9 ] / 2 =72 →(81k -162) - (9k -36)=72k -126=144→72k=270→k=3.5, nope.\n\nn=10: P(k,10)= [ (k-2)*100 - (k-4)*10 ] / 2 =72 →(100k -200) - (10k -40)=90k -160=144→90k=304→k≈3.378, nope.\n\nn=11: [ (k-2)*121 - (k-4)*11 ] / 2 =72 →(121k -242) - (11k -44)=110k -198=144→110k=342→k≈3.109, nope.\n\nn=12: [ (k-2)*144 - (k-4)*12 ] / 2 =72 →(144k -288) - (12k -48)=132k -240=144→132k=384→k≈2.909, nope.\n\nn=5: P(k,5)= [ (k-2)*25 - (k-4)*5 ] / 2 =72 →(25k -50) - (5k -20)=20k -30=144→20k=174→k≈8.7, nope.\n\nHmm. So it's looking like after the initial pronic numbers and 72, which isn't a polygonal number beyond its own count, there are no other such numbers. So maybe besides 0,2, the others aren't part of any known polygonal sequences. But I'm not sure if that's accurate because perhaps someone has found another.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 72 is considered as a polygonal number but only with k=4? Let me check:\n\nP(8,1)=1, which isn't72. P(8,2)=8, no. P(8,3)=20, nope. Wait no, the formula for square numbers is (n-1)*n +1.\n\nWait maybe my brain is getting tangled here. Alternatively, perhaps 72 can be represented as a polygonal number in other ways beyond being pronic.\n\nBut given all this, it seems that except for0,2, there are no known polygonal numbers which are also pronic with higher k>3. Therefore, the answer would be that only 0 and2 satisfy both conditions.\n\nWait wait, but earlier I thought n=8 gives72 as a pronic number (P(8,8)=72). So is72 part of any polygonal numbers? Let me check for k=16: P(16,n) would be the 16-gon formula. For n=4: P(16,4)= [16-2]*4² - (16-4)*4 ] /2 →[14*16 -12*4]/2 = (224 -48)/2 =176/2=88≠72. So n is not integer here.\n\nWait perhaps n=3: [ (16-2)*9 - (16-4)*3 ] / 2 →(14*9 -12*3)/2=(126 -36)/2=90/2=45≠72. No.\n\nn=5: [14*25 -12*5]/2→[350 -60]/2=290/2=145≠72.\n\nHmm, so 72 doesn't seem to be part of any polygonal number for higher k>3. So the only numbers that are both pronic and polygonal beyond just being pronic would have to be those where they can also fit into some other polygon formula with integer n>=1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another approach: considering that a polygonal number is equivalent to a centered square number or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the only such numbers are 0 and2, which seem to satisfy both conditions for any k.\n\nWait in summary:\n\nPronic numbers: n(n+1), starting from0→0,2,6,12, etc.\n\nPolygonal numbers: [ (k-2)n² - (k-4)n ] /2, starting with k=3 andn>=1.\n\nLooking for n,n' where P(m,n)=P(k',n') and m=n'+1 or something. Or perhaps looking for the intersection of these sequences beyond the initial terms.\n\nBut from my earlier attempts, beyond0,2,72 is not a polygonal number beyond its own pronic status. So maybe the answer is only0 and2.\n\nAlternatively, let me check n=9: P(k,9)= [ (k-2)*81 - (k-4)*9 ] / 2 = [81k -162 -9k +36]/2→(72k -126)/2=36k -63. Set equal to72: 36k -63=72 →36k=135→k≈3.75, not integer.\n\nn=10: P(k,10)= [ (k-2)*100 - (k-4)*10 ] /2 = [100k -200 -10k +40]/2=(90k -160)/2=45k -80. Set equal to72: 45k=152→k≈3.377, nope.\n\nn=11:P(k,11)= [ (k-2)*121 - (k-4)*11 ] /2 →[121k -242 -11k +44]/2=(110k -198)/2=55k -99. Set equal to72:55k=171→k≈3.109, nope.\n\nn=12:P(k,12)= [ (k-2)*144 - (k-4)*12 ] /2 →[144k -288 -12k +48]/2=(132k -240)/2=66k -120. Set equal to72:66k=212→k≈3.21, nope.\n\nn=13:P(k,13)= [ (k-2)*169 - (k-4)*13 ] /2 →[169k -338 -13k +52]/2=(156k -286)/2=78k -143. Set equal to72:78k=215→k≈2.75, nope.\n\nn=14:P(k,14)= [ (k-2)*196 - (k-4)*14 ] /2 →[196k -392 -14k +56]/2=(182k -336)/2=91k -168. Set equal to72:91k=240→k≈2.64, nope.\n\nn=15:P(k,15)= [ (k-2)*225 - (k-4)*15 ] /2 →[225k -450 -15k +60]/2=(210k -390)/2=105k -195. Set equal to72:105k=267→k≈2.53, nope.\n\nn=16:P(k,16)= [ (k-2)*256 - (k-4)*16 ] /2 →[256k -512 -16k +64]/2=(240k -448)/2=120k -224. Set equal to72:120k=300→k=2.5, which is less than3, so invalid since k>=3.\n\nWait maybe n=0 orn=-1? P(k,-1)= [ (k-2)*(-1)^2 - (k-4)*(-1) ] /2 →[ (k-2)(1) - (k-4)(-1) ]/2→(k-2 + k -4)/2=(2k -6)/2=k-3. So set equal to72: k-3=72→k=75. So P(k,0)=P(k',1): 0= [ (75-2)*0² - (75-4)*0 ] /2 →0=0. Hmm, so maybe n=0 in a polygon with any k? But that seems trivial.\n\nAlternatively, n=-1: but perhaps negative sides don't make sense here.\n\nWait I'm getting too deep into this now. Given all my attempts, except for the first few terms (n=0 andn=7), 72 doesn't seem to appear in any higher polygonal number beyond its own count. So maybe the answer is only0 and2. Because:\n\n- For m=n', P(m,n)=P(k',n') andm =n'+1.\n\nBut I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps there are other numbers which can be represented both as pronic and another polygonal formula beyond their own count. But given the checks above for n from0 to16 in various polygons k=3 up, it's clear that after 0 and2, no others.\n\nTherefore, I think the only such numbers are0 and2.\n</think>\n\nThe only numbers that satisfy both being pronic (product of two consecutive integers) and polygonal with sides greater than or equal to three are:\n\n$\\boxed{0}$ and $\\boxed{2}$."

I'm not sure if there are others. Maybe some medieval or early papal figures? Hmm, I think the main ones are these two. They were both married in their early days. Alexander VI was born around 928 AD, so he probably married someone before he became pope. John Paul II, on the other hand, was a bit later; he was promoted to popish in 1346, and I believe his marriage happened during that time. Are there any others? Oh, I'm pretty sure those are the only two. The rest of the papal line includes other几位 like John Paul III, but they were popes until their death. So maybe just these two.\n\nI should make sure about the years. Alexander VI was indeed born in 928 AD and died around 1005. John Paul II got promoted to pope in 1346, married a while later.

        "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out which relational database management systems are open source. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about this topic.\n\nFirst off, I remember that there are several major databases and their respective management systems. The main ones are MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle, InfluxDB, Teradata, maybe something else... Oh wait, also relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and maybe others.\n\nI think MySQL was open source initially because MySQL DBMS was written in C with a lot of customizations for MySQL-specific database engines. That makes sense because if the core system is under the open-source control, other applications can use it without worrying about proprietary issues.\n\nNext up is SQL Server. I know that some version of SQL Server had an active open source project called MSMS (Maintenance Service Module), which was part of SQL Server's maintenance tools. So, even though SQL Server itself might not be entirely open source, the underlying DBMS and some services are still under Open Source Control.\n\nThen there's Oracle. I'm pretty sure Oracle has a lot of customizations for their databases, like ODBC drivers, so they didn't release all of their code to the public. This means that while Oracle itself isn't open source, many parts of their systems can be modified by developers.\n\nWhat about InfluxDB? It's an in-memory database and it's open source because it's written in C++. That’s a unique one since most databases are written in other languages or rely on proprietary libraries. InfluxDB being open source means it can be integrated with other open sources without issues, which is great for real-time analytics.\n\nTeradata too, I believe has an active project called Teradata Systems. They've been releasing their DBMS under an open-source control since 2017, so that's a good one to include.\n\nAfter that, there are some more modern systems like MongoDB and PostgreSQL. MongoDB is often considered non-open source because it uses a custom JSON engine by default, which may not be fully open source. However, I've heard that some versions have had some work done on their JSON support, so maybe they're still considered under Open Source Control.\n\nWait, what about other relational databases like MySQL, which I already mentioned? Oh right, MySQL is definitely open source because its DBMS was developed with customization in mind for the MySQL engine. That's a solid point to include.\n\nI also recall something about Apache. They have several services and libraries. For instance, Java EE 6 Service Provider is under Apache Tomcat, which has an active open source control. Similarly, Apache Hadoop has their own distributed files system and service providers that might be open source.\n\nSo putting this together, the main ones I can think of are MySQL, SQL Server (with MSMS), Oracle with ODBC drivers, InfluxDB, Teradata, MongoDB (with some work done on JSON support), Apache Tomcat, Apache Hadoop's services, Doctrine and Spring Boot as frameworks. Also, maybe others like Flink or Alacritas if they're open source.\n\nI should make sure I haven't missed any major ones. Let me see: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSMS (for SQL Server), ODBCDriver for Oracle, InfluxDB, Teradata, MongoDB, Apache Tomcat, Apache Hadoop, Doctrine, Spring Boot, Flink, Alacritas. That seems comprehensive.\n\nI think I covered all the main systems with an open-source perspective, including those that have some active projects and others where the core functionality is under control but may still be widely used.\n</think>\n\nThe open source relational database management systems include:\n\n1. **MySQL** - Open Source with its DBMS customizations.\n2. **SQL Server** - Supports MSMS (Maintenance Service Module) as an open-source project.\n3. **Oracle** - Uses ODBCDriver for customization.\n4. **InfluxDB** - Open source due to C++ implementation.\n5. **Teradata** - Active control of Teradata Systems.\n6. **MongoDB** - Some work on JSON support, considered under Open Source Control.\n7. **Apache Tomcat** - Java EE Service Provider with active open-source control.\n8. **Apache Hadoop** - Services and distributed files are under Apache.\n9. **Doctrine Framework** - Open source for ORM.\n10. **Spring Boot** - Open source for development.\n11. **Flink** - Open source as an extension of Flink Core.\n12. **Alacritas** - Active framework with open-source control.\n\nThese systems either have active open source projects or are fundamentally under their open-source control, offering flexibility and community support."

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which rugby union teams have Chilean players. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with all the clubs in Chile, but let's think this through step by step.\n\nFirst off, I know that Chile is a pretty large country, and it has several professional clubs, especially in rugby. The most obvious one would be the Chilean Rugby Union, right? They are based there, so obviously they have players from Chile. But maybe there are others as well.\n\nI remember hearing about the National Rugby Union of Chile (NURU) before; that's definitely one. I think it's like a team organization in Chile, but more commonly known as the NURU. So that's another team with Chilean players.\n\nThen, I should consider the State Champs de Rio Grande, which I believe is based in Santiago. I'm not entirely sure about their name, but they are a professional club, so they'd have their own teams from Chile. Maybe there's a specific team called something like \"Clave de la Ollama\" or similar.\n\nI also recall the Equinor Club of Clmentino, which is another name for the State Champs de Santiago. So that would be another team with Chilean players.\n\nWait, are there any other clubs from Chile in rugby? I'm not sure. Maybe the Azul Rugby Union, but I don't think they're as prominent. The Andina Valley Rugby Union could also be an option, but again, not too familiar with their specifics.\n\nI should make sure to list each team correctly. So, starting with NURU, then State Champs de Santiago or Clmentino, and Equinor Club of Clmentimo. I think that covers the main ones. Are there any others? Maybe the Argentine Rugby Union? No, because they are based in Argentina. The Brazilian URA is also based in Brazil, so probably not Chilean.\n\nI should double-check to avoid missing any teams. Let me see: NURU (Chilean), State Champs de Santiago/Clmentino (chil complex), Equinor Club of Clmentimo. That seems about right. I don't think there are more clubs specifically based in Chile that have Chilean players.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which saints died by crucifixion. Hmm, I remember that the Crucifixion is a religious event where Jesus was executed by the Roman authorities. So, saints who are traditionally associated with crucifixions would be important here.\n\nFirst, I think of Jesus himself because he's central to this event. But he wasn't a saint in the traditional sense; he was a human being, not a saint as defined by religious orthodoxy. So maybe that doesn't count.\n\nNext, there's St. Peter, the Apostle. He's mentioned in some crucifixion stories, so I should include him. Then, the Second-Level十字善会, which includes his immediate followers and those who came after him. That would be St. Andrew, Peter, and John. Wait, no—Peter is a separate saint. So maybe the Second-Level includes both Peter and his followers.\n\nAlso, there's another level of十字善会 called the Third-Level, but I'm not sure if that was considered during crucifixion events. It might have been later, so perhaps it wasn't part of the crucifixion process itself.\n\nWait, is there any other saint associated with crucifixion? Maybe some saints died by crucifixion because of their actions or roles in crucifixions. For example, St. Andrew could have been a figure that received crucifixion, but I'm not sure about his actual death details.\n\nAlso, I remember something about the Cruciform being a symbol of crucifixion. But does that directly relate to saints? Maybe some saints were represented by this symbol. Not too sure on that point.\n\nI think the main saints associated with crucifixion are Jesus (as he's central), St. Peter, and perhaps others from the Second-Level十字善会 like John, Andrew, and Thomas. The Third-Level might not have contributed a significant saint here because it was after the crucifixion itself.\n\nWait, I also recall that some saints died in crucifixion scenarios but weren't actual saints. Like the Second-Level includes John, St. Peter, and others from a later period. But if we're strictly looking for saints who are traditionally recognized, maybe only Jesus, St. Peter, and perhaps Thomas?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another saint associated with crucifixion that I'm not aware of. Perhaps someone in an early Roman community? Or maybe a figure who was directly crucified by a Roman official.\n\nI think the most accurate list would include Jesus, St. Peter, and others from the Second-Level. So, including Peter (the Apostle), Andrew, John, and Thomas. But I'm not entirely certain if Thomas was part of that group because he died in the 3rd century, whereas crucifixion events were around the same time as his death.\n\nWait, maybe only St. Peter is considered a saint in this context, with Jesus being more human. Then, perhaps the Second-Level includes others like Andrew and John. The Third-Level might have contributed to crucifixion scenarios but didn't add new saints.\n\nI think I'll go with that list: Jesus, Peter (the Apostle), Andrew, and John as the main saints associated with crucifixion.\n</think>\n\nJesus, St. Peter, Andrew, and John died by crucifixion."

So first, I need to identify all saints who were born on or after February 28, 1976.\n\nI remember that many saints were born in the late 20th century. Let me think about some of them. For example, Saint James Pone (1835) was born near Tutu's home, so he might be included. But wait, is his feast day on February 29? I'm not sure if that's accurate because he died in 1875, so maybe he didn't have a feast day or it wasn't celebrated as much.\n\nAnother one could be Saint George Canning (1842). I think they were born around that time. Then there's Saint John Canning from 1913 to 1960. Both died in March, so their feast days might not align with Tutu's birthday.\n\nI should list all saints who have feasts on or after February 28.

Thompson, born in 1903, which might fit.\n\nWait, are there others? Perhaps some who were active post-war. There's Saint T. J. White (1917) and St. C.A. Lewis (1924), both born after Tutu but died before Tutu, so their feast days could coincide with Tutu's birthday.\n\nI think that covers the main ones: James Pone, George Canning, John Canning, Gabbard, Thompson, and Lewis.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which saints have their feast day on June 15th. Hmm, let's start by understanding what a saint's feast day means. From what I know, in many cultures, especially Eastern Orthodox Christianity, saints have feasts or obits dedicated to them. The feast date is usually when the Holy Eucharist is taken, and it varies between regions.\n\nI remember that in the Catholic Church, the feast days for saints are known as the \"Eucharistic Feasts.\" Each saint's feast day is on the same Sunday each year, I think. So, to find out if a saint's feast day is on June 15th, I need to look up the specific dates for various saints.\n\nI'll start by listing some saints and their typical feast days. For example, Saint George, who was a military leader, had his feast around April or May of each year. So that doesn't hit June 15th. Then there's Saint Michael, a bishop, whose feast is usually in late March or early April again. \n\nI should check each saint one by one to see if any have their feast on June 15th. Let me think about other saints too. Saints like Saint Peter and Saint John Paul II come to mind. Saint Peter's feast is around October every year, so that won't be on June 15th. Saint John Paul II was a spiritual leader and his feast dates are in late March each year.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some. Let me think more carefully. Are there any saints known for having feasts in the latter part of the year? I'm not sure about any others. Maybe I should check if any saints have feasts around June 15th specifically. \n\nHmm, considering that the feast dates are typically consistent and known through religious texts or biographies, it's possible that some saints don't have feasts on June 15th. So perhaps there aren't many saints with feasts on that specific date. I'll need to verify each saint individually.\n\nBut since this is a thought process, let me outline the steps: \n\n1. List all saints.\n2. Look up their typical feast dates.\n3. Check if any of those are June 15th.\n\nI think after checking, it might be that no saints have their feast on June 15th.

Hmm, let's start by thinking about cities in Italy and the popular sauces associated with them.\n\nFirst off, Florence comes to mind because there's such a famous sauce called Florence sauce. That's one right there. Then there's Venice, but wait, Venice is more known for wine and seafood, not as much for a sauce. Maybe I should check that. Oh yeah, I think it's \"Venice sauce.\" \n\nTrento is another city with several sauces. Trebbine sauce is definitely famous. Innsbruck? I'm not sure if they have a main sauce named after them. Maybe something like \"Innsbruck sauce\"? Not too familiar.\n\nMilano has some dishes, but again, maybe the main sauce isn't as prominent. I don't recall a sauce specifically named after Milano. Then there's Pisa, which is famous for pizza, but pizza sauce might be called Pizzavenza. That could be another entry.\n\nPiedmonte is a bit vague. Maybe there are several sauces from different regions in the region. For example, Pavia's sauce or Pomodoro sauce? I'm not sure about those. Or maybe \"Perugia sauce,\" which is used in some Italian restaurants near Perugia city.\n\nThen there's Umbria, but again, more about cooking than a specific sauce. Lastly, Verona might have something like Veronese sauce. But I'm not certain if that's considered part of the list or just an umbrella term.\n\nWait, so putting it together: Florence, Venice sauce, Trebbine sauce, Innsbruck sauce (though I'm not sure), Pizzavenza from Pisa, Pavia sauce, Pomodoro sauce, Perugia sauce, Veronese sauce. That gives me eight sauces named after Italian cities.\n\nI think that's all the main ones. But maybe some are less well-known or not widely celebrated. So I'll list them out as such.\n</think>\n\n Florence, Venice sauce, Trebbine sauce, Innsbruck sauce (if applicable), Pizzavenza, Pavia sauce, Pomodoro sauce, Perugia sauce, Veronese sauce"

        "<think>\nOkay, so the user is asking which sauces contain onions and garlic. I need to figure out all the possible sauces that have both. Let's start by thinking about common sauces people know of.\n\nFirst, there's ketchup. Ketchup has onions in it, but does it also have a significant amount of garlic? I think onions are more dominant here since ketchup is a popular drink and often served alongside garlic. I'm pretty sure onions make up most of the sauce, so that fits.\n\nNext, pickling sauce comes to mind. Pickling involves using onions as part of the picking process. It's common for pickling sauces to have a good amount of garlic. So that would be another one.\n\nThen there are hot sauces like sauces from Japanese restaurants or Mexican places. They often use onions and garlic in their dishes, especially when making things spicy. I'm pretty sure they mix both in significant quantities.\n\nBaked goods might also include onions and garlic. For example, baked chicken or baked meats often use onions as a topping along with some garlic for flavor. That's another sauce to include.\n\nI should check if there are any other sauces I might be missing. Let me think of other cuisines. There's Chinese takeout sauces that sometimes use onions, maybe? But that's more like pickling and ketchup than the main ingredient. Maybe not as common.\n\nAlso, red wine sauce is another one. I believe it has a lot of onions and garlic in its acidity. That could be another entry.\n\nAre there any other types of sauces? Perhaps things like mustard or balsamic, but those are more about seasonings rather than the sauce itself. So maybe not relevant here.\n\nWait, should I include things like pickling sauce multiple times since it's a common one? Probably just list it once. Similarly, ketchup and hot sauces can each be included separately.\n\nI should also make sure there are no other popular sauces that use onions and garlic without being too obscure. Maybe check some cooking blogs or quick research to confirm I'm not missing anything like that. But from what I know, the main ones are ketchup, pickling sauce, hot sauces, baked goods, and red wine sauce.\n\nSo, compiling this, the sauces would be: ketchup, pickling sauce, hot sauces (like Japanese, Mexican), baked goods with onions, and red wine sauce.\n</think>\n\nketchup, pickling sauce, hot sauces (like those from Japanese or Mexican cuisines), baked goods that use onions along with garlic for flavor, and red wine sauce."

She is known for \"The Godfather,\" but that's just one movie. Now, she might have worked on others with her co-star, Robert De Niro. There was a film called \"Manchuska\" where they had a bit of a fight scene. That should be included.\n\nNext, I recall she starred in \"Dune.\" That's definitely a big part of Thurman's career. After that, there might have been other films with De Niro alongside her. I think there was another film called \"The Godfather Part II: The Aftermath\" but wait, isn't that part 2 of the first movie? She didn't make a second part. So, maybe she starred in a few more movies.\n\nI should check if there are any other notable works. I remember a film called \"The Dark Knight: The Final Chapter.\" Wait, no, that's a sequel to the first Manchuska film. Maybe another one with De Niro? Perhaps \"The Giver\"? No, that was with Shoshana Stansfield. Oh, I think she did work on \"The Exorcist\" as well, which is a horror movie.\n\nSo putting it all together, the movies Uma Thurman has starred in include The Godfather (Part 1), Manchuska, Dune, and The Giver.

The user is asking about alumni's contributions to film and literature, specifically their directors. They want a list, but if it's not possible, they should return 'idk'. Also, if there are no answers, it should be 'no answer'.\n\nI remember that the University of Bergen has a strong academic reputation, so maybe some famous directors from their departments? Let me think... The Department of English and Literature probably has well-known authors. I recall someone named Arild Aaboe who wrote about ancient cultures. Maybe he directed something related to literature or history.\n\nOh, there's the film \"The Great Wall of China\" which was directed by a Norwegian director. That could be someone from Bergen. What else? The University of Bergen also has a strong focus on science and technology, so perhaps directors in that field have contributed to some films too. I think someone named Trygve Nøri directed a film called \"The Endless Future,\" which is about the future of the world.\n\nI'm not sure about others. Maybe some scientists or philosophers? Perhaps someone from the Department of History and Philosophy? They might have directed something about history, like \"Euler's Time\" or something similar. I think they did a movie that blended Euler's work with historical themes.\n\nWait, there are also literature and science books published by them. I remember authors like John Ockendon and Andrew J. G. Howson. Maybe these wrote films on their works, but I'm not sure who directed the actual movies.\n\nI don't know about other departments or specific films.

I'm not sure about that specifically. Maybe the main companies based there are part of larger groups or subsidiaries?\n\nI recall that Huawei, for instance, was founded in China, and I think it has a presence in Shenzhen. So maybe they're considered to be based there. Similarly, Redmi,华为, and Galaxie are all big names in Chinese smartphones. But is their base located in Dongguan? It might depend on the specific manufacturing facilities or subsidiaries.\n\nWait, maybe not every single brand made by a company in Dongguan is listed here. It's possible that many companies there don't make as many devices as others like Redmi 5G. Also, I'm not sure if all these brands have a base in Dongguan specifically, just that they're based in Shenzhen or other Chinese tech hubs.\n\nI should also consider whether the question is asking for all possible brands made by companies there or specific ones.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but let's start with what I remember.\n\nEndemic means something that is native to a specific place, right? So Chile is known for its diverse ecosystems. Let me think about animals from there. I've heard of the Andean mountains and how they have various species along them. There's the Orangetestis I'm pretty sure is an ibex found in Chile. They're used for hunting bears.\n\nWait, there are also some birds. The Pachyptelos plumis seems like a common bird in Chile, maybe one of the common birds from South America. But wait, do I have all the species? Let me think again.\n\nI remember seeing a few more animals. Maybe the marmots or snowcats? No, those are found in other regions. Wait, there's the Cibola alba, which is an antelope, right? Also, the Chelyabinsk fox might be found in Chile, but I'm not sure if it's considered endemic to that specific area.\n\nOh, and the Puleva pygmy bat could be from Chile.

Maybe some species of foxes, like the Pachyptelidae family?\n\nI'm trying to list them without getting too confused.

Then there are the Pachyptelidae family birds like the Pigeon and maybe some other species as well.\n\nI'm getting a bit stuck because I can't remember all of them. Let me try to recall: Orangetestis, Cibola alba, Pyceris sinensis, Puleva bat (a fox), and possibly others. Maybe there are also some marmots or other animals from Chile?\n\nWait, the user said \"exhaustive list,\" so I need all of them. Let me try to piece together a list:\n\n1. Orangetestis ibex - bison\n2. Cibola alba - antelope\n3. Pyceris sinensis - bird\n4. Puleva bat (fox) - fox\n5. Pigeon - pigeon\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's all. Did Chile have other species?

Oh right, there are also the Pyceris sinensis and maybe another bird like the Cynogys sinensis.

Hmm, I need to figure out which observatories are there.\n\nFirst off, I know Chile has a couple of big telescopes. The Atacama and La Silla. The Atacama is famous for its wide field view, and the La Silla offers deep field observations. Both use mirrors.\n\nI remember the Atacama Cosmology Telescope was a big deal when it launched in 2010. It's pretty widely used now. But wait, they had some issues with their mirrors getting damaged early on, which limited its functionality beyond just telescopes. So, I should mention that as a limitation.\n\nThen there's La Silla, which is smaller but more affordable. They're better known for the Hubble Space Telescope, and it still works well even though the mirror has degraded clarity. That's interesting because it shows both older and newer observations are possible.\n\nThe user also mentioned countries bordering Chile. The main ones include Argentina and Brazil. I know the Atacama is in Argentina, so that's clear. For Brazil, I think the Iguay telescope exists there. It was launched in 2017 and has similar mirrors but might be more complex, though not as widely used.\n\nSo putting it all together, Chile hosts telescopes in two main locations: Atacama and La Silla. Plus, they have observatories in neighboring countries like Argentina for the Atacama and Brazil for the Iguay. I should include that to give a complete picture.\n</think>\n\nChile is home to several prominent astronomical observatories, with notable ones including the **Atacama Cosmology Telescope** and the **La Silla telescope**, which are both still operational.

Let's start by thinking about the most obvious ones. I remember the Keck telescope is pretty big and famous. It was built by the University of California in Los Angeles, right? So that's one. \n\nThen there's the James Webb Space Telescope. Wait, isn't it located near Earth but out in space? Yes, I think it's about 150 million kilometers away. That's pretty far from Chile though—maybe a bit closer than I thought.\n\nAnother telescope comes to mind. There are those high-resolution ones used for astronomical observations. I believe the Atacama Cosmology Telescope uses a large mirror and is in Svalbard, which is actually in the Arctic region, not Chile. So that's probably not it.\n\nWait, maybe there are others like the Hubble telescope? No, the Hubble was launched into space around 1990 when I think Chile wasn't too far from Earth at that time. Plus, I don't recall any telescopes based in Chile that were operational right now.\n\nI'm trying to remember if there's a big one. Oh, the Schmidt telescope. I've heard of it being used for space. But where is it located? It might be in Chile or maybe another Chilean city. I think it's part of a network of telescopes that are based in the Andes, which includes areas around Chile.\n\nAnother one could be the William Herschel Telescope. I believe it was part of an old optical telescope project and was built in 1796. It's not from Chile though, but maybe located elsewhere.\n\nWait, is there a new high-resolution telescope? I've heard about the James Webb and perhaps others, but their locations might be outside Chile. So, putting it all together, the most significant telescopes based in Chile are the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (atacam.org) and the Schmidt telescope network (schmidt telescope network). Maybe there's more, but I can't think of any right now.\n\nLet me check if I missed anything. The Hubble was near Chile, but it's not operational now. The James Webb is also out of Chile.

It's named after Alan Turing, who was a pioneer in computing. Now, who are the recipients? I remember some big names from history or recent events. \n\nLet me think about the award winners that I can recall. I believe some were from Europe themselves. For example, David Spahni received the Turing Award in 2019 for his work on \"The Power of AI.\" That's a European country, so he would fit into this group.\n\nAnother one could be Yehuda Lindell and Nissner from 2020. I'm pretty sure they were based in Israel. But wait, are they considered European? Yeah, because Israel is part of what's called the European Union's area. So that counts too.\n\nWhat about someone like Tim Roughgarden in 2018? He was also from the US, specifically New York. So he wouldn't be counted here because we're looking for those born in Europe.\n\nGoing back further, there were recipients from various European countries and regions. Let me think about a few more. Maybe Ulrich Karger in 2014; he was from the Netherlands. That fits into Europe. Also, Emanuele Viola in 2016 from Italy – that's another European country.\n\nAnother one is Oded Goldreich in 2015, who was also from Israel. So even though some were in specific countries within Europe, their regions are part of Europe as well. \n\nWho else? Maybe Shouryehzeh Hashemi in 2013 and Assaf Naor in 2017. Both received the award in Israel, which is a part of Europe. So they definitely make the cut.\n\nLet me check if I can think of others. Perhaps Thomas Thormen Pedersen in 2018 – no, he's from Denmark. That doesn't count because he's not European. Maybe someone else? Wait, there's a person from the UK, but I'm not sure. Maybe not, as the award is given every year and it might be a few more in different areas.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The ones I have are David Spahni, Yehuda Lindell & Nissner, Oded Goldreich, Ulrich Karger, Emanuele Viola, Shouryehzeh Hashemi, Assaf Naor. Are there others?

Or someone else from another EU country, like Italy or France?\n\nHmm, perhaps there are others. Let me try to think of other notable Turing Award recipients and see if they fit. For instance, Amos Ron from Israel in 2017 – yes, he's European. Or maybe others? I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another one could be someone like Yehuda Lindell, who we already included. Maybe there are more recent ones. Let me think: Oded Goldreich in 2015, Ulrich Karger in 2014, Shouryehzeh Hashemi in 2013, Emanuele Viola in 2016, Assaf Naor in 2017, David Spahni in 2019. That's six names.\n\nBut wait, are there any others? Maybe someone from France or Italy. Or perhaps an American who was European but not listed here.

        "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out which video games are known to be NP-complete. Hmm, I'm not very familiar with this topic, but I'll try to think it through.\n\nFirst, what is NP-complete? From what I remember, a problem is NP-complete if it's both in the set of problems that can be verified quickly (NP) and every other problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time. So, essentially, these are the hardest problems in NP. If someone proves another problem is NP-complete, they're solving one of the big mysteries in computer science.\n\nNow, video games are a big part of this. I know that some games have been shown to correspond directly or indirectly with NP-complete problems. But which ones? Let me think about games that were popular and discussed in literature or forums for their computational complexity.\n\nI've heard about \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\" It's been cited in some contexts where people argue its computational difficulty. Also, \"The Last of Us\" came up because of game theory questions related to optimal decision-making. But are those all NP-complete? I'm not entirely sure, but they seem like candidates.\n\nAre there other games that fit this category? Maybe something like \"Clannad.\" I think it's often mentioned in the context of computer science problems. Or maybe \"The Elder Scrolls\" series—any particular game within them?\n\nWait, is there a systematic way to approach this? Perhaps I can list out some popular video games and see which ones have been discussed regarding NP-completeness.\n\nI should also consider that while these games are associated with complexity theory, they might not all be directly NP-complete. Some could be more about game mechanics or strategy rather than actual computational problems.\n\nAdditionally, perhaps some games use strategies similar to solving puzzles, which can tie into the P vs NP problem. But I'm not sure if any specific games fit that bill as well.\n\nI think it's best to go with the known ones mentioned and maybe add one more just in case. So, \"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,\" \"The Last of Us,\" \"Clannad,\" and \"The Elder Scrolls IV.\" That seems comprehensive for now.\n</think>\n\nThe video games that are known to be NP-complete include:\n\n\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild\", \"The Last of Us\", \"Clannad\", and \"The Elder Scrolls IV\"."

The user might be referring to the Sven fox at the beginning of the game and the Fox Stabber from around level 60. These are definitely in popular games, so I should include those too.\n\nThen there's \"Frogs: Evan on the Moon,\" where Evan is a fox character that gains more power as he progresses. That's another classic, right?\n\n\"Super Mario 64\" also has the one_solved_me_99 character with a fox shape, but it's not used in combat. So I'll note that separately.\n\nThe user might be referring to \"Stardew Valley,\" which has a character named Fox, though she’s more of a friend and has a different appearance compared to Mario's version. Still, it's often seen as having the same vibe.\n\n\"Super Mario 64\" again features the one_solved_me_99 character, which is similar in look but not used in combat. That adds another entry.\n\nIn \"The Legend of Zelda,\" there are characters like Flare, who has a fox-like appearance when using the snake's mouth. But she's more of a friend and uses it for different purposes than combat.\n\nFor online games, \"The Witcher 3\" has a character named Sven, similar to the one in Super Mario 64. That's another instance where the Fox theme is present.\n\nLastly, I think about \"Stardew Valley,\" but earlier I mentioned that. Maybe the user wants more details on her appearance or role? Since they just asked for the games, and she can be considered a fox character, it fits.\n\nI should also check if there are any other games where Fox appears. Sometimes users might refer to the same as someone else's character. For example, \"Star Quest\" features a character named Sven, which is similar in appearance to the one from Super Mario 64.\n\nSo compiling all that, I can list these games: Super Mario 64 (one_solved_me_99), Minecraft, Frogs: Evan on the Moon, Super Mario 64 again (one_solved_me_99), Stardew Valley (Fox), The Legend of Zelda (Flare), The Witcher 3 (Sven). That gives a comprehensive list. I think that's all for now.\n</think>\n\nSuper Mario 64 one_solved_me_99, Minecraft, Frogs: Evan on the Moon, Super Mario 64 one_solved_me_99, Stardew Valley Fox, The Legend of Zelda Flare, The Witcher 3 Sven."

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which video games have won Best Esports Game of the Year at The Game Awards. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with all the details about this award, but I'll try to break it down.\n\nFirst off, I know that the award is given annually by The Game Awards for the top game in the Esports category. So they look at things like playability, creativity, and maybe other esport-related factors. But wait, I'm not sure if all of these are the same or if some criteria might vary. Maybe it's more about how each game was received by players?\n\nI remember that a few major titles have made it to this list. For example, Star Wars V: The Force Awakens and Star Wars VII: The Force is pretty popular, so they probably got mentions there. The Game itself definitely won too because it's the go-to for esports. There's also something called The Legend of Zelda series—maybe Zelda: Breath of the Wild or its sequel?\n\nI'm not sure about all the specific titles though. Maybe I should think about other notable games that were popular around that time. Like, is there a game like FIFA 18 or League of Legends that made it? Or maybe something from other genres like Minecraft or Minecraft 3? Those might have been in play but aren't necessarily the top picks.\n\nWait, I also remember some online gaming sites like MOBA24 mentioning specific games each year. Maybe that's a good source for accurate information. But since I'm not given those sources here, I'll have to rely on general knowledge.\n\nSo putting it all together, the main contenders would likely include Star Wars V, The Game, The Legend of Zelda series (maybe in different forms), and perhaps some titles from other franchises like Minecraft or even newer games that were popular at the time but didn't make it. I'm not entirely sure about all the specifics though.\n\nI should also consider if there are any exceptions or less mainstream games that made it into this list. Maybe something by a lesser-known developer? Or maybe a mix of genres where different titles shine.\n\nIn summary, without specific sources, I can include several well-known and popular games but might miss some obscure entries. I'll make sure to mention the ones I'm confident about and note that there may be others that aren't as widely celebrated.\n</think>\n\nThe Game Awards often recognize excellence in esports with awards like Best Esports Game of the Year. Notable titles include *Star Wars V: The Force Awakens* (2015), *The Game* (2017), and a series from *The Legend of Zelda*. These games have been widely popular, but others like *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* and *The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time* may also be considered. There may be other titles that were significant at that time but weren't as prominent."

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out which wars took place in South America. Let's start by recalling the major regions involved. Brazil is a key player here because it's part of South America and also has been involved in several global conflicts.\n\nI remember that the United States had some issues with Brazil. There was this conflict that started in the late 1970s, maybe around 1976 or so, where the US tried to take over from Brazil after they won the Civil War. That's one big event I think happened there.\n\nAnother thing is the Anadoluobuladu war. I believe this was a huge conflict that involved Turkey and Turkey's neighbor Brazil in 2014. It ended up being a military conflict, not just a battle for control of oil.\n\nThen there's the Amazon War. This was about control of the Amazon rainforest from Western Europe. The US had some influence there during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but it wasn't a major global war that people generally know about.\n\nThere's also the Ceará Revolution of 1856. This was a struggle between the Azul government in the eastern Amazon region and the indigenous Patoones. It really shaped South American history because it led to the establishment of the independence of the Amazon region, which was crucial for its development.\n\nLastly, there's the Rio Grande-Amazon War of 1871. This involved the US, Canada, and Australia fighting over control of the Rio Grande and Amazon river systems in South America. It ended with the US winning, which is why it's sometimes called the \"Golden Age\" war for South America.\n\nI think that covers the major ones. I should make sure to list them clearly without any abbreviations or acronyms as per the instructions.\n</think>\n\nUnited States of America vs Brazil (1976–2004)  \nAnadoluobuladu War (2014)  \nCeará Revolution of 1856  \nAmérica Amazona de 1856  \nRio Grande-Amazon War of 1871",

French is a major language spoken around the world, especially in North America. I remember that authors like Jean-Paul Sartre are French, but does he actually write in French? Wait, no, he writes in English. So maybe someone else. Maybe Yves Biery? I think he wrote \"Le Grand Monde,\" which was a major work in France, so that makes sense. Then maybe Jérome Lemoyne, another French author known for his books. Oh, and Pierre-Auguste Verhaeghe is also French and definitely associated with a French literary movement.\n\nNext, for writers who speak Arabic. Arabic is widely spoken, especially in North America, but also in Asia. I know Ezzat Mertens wrote \"The Boy\", which was a major success in Arabic-speaking countries. Also, authors like Nour El Hidari are prominent Arabic speakers and have written extensively in Arabic literature.\n\nFor Japanese writers, Japan is the second largest language globally. They've got some famous authors too. Maybe Etsuji Kamehara wrote \"I See\". That's pretty iconic. Also, Kiyonori Goto has written a lot of books in Japanese, and Naofumi Tanaka is known for his works in that genre.\n\nWait, did I cover all the main ones? French: Jean-Paul Sartre, Yves Biery, Jérome Lemoyne, Pierre-Auguste Verhaeghe. Arabic: Ezzat Mertens, Nour El Hidari.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out which YouTube channels have more than 500,000 subscribers and talk about math. Hmm, that's a specific question, but it's also pretty detailed. Let me start by thinking about what kind of channels would get around 500k subscribers on a weekly or daily basis.\n\nFirst off, I know that many educational channels cover various subjects, including math. YouTube has a lot of these channels. I remember seeing some big ones like Numberphile and Mathologer; they're definitely in the tech or education category. They probably post a lot of content related to numbers and mathematical concepts.\n\nThen there are channels that specifically focus on math topics. Some popular ones might be ThinkificallyMath or Math with Mr. J, where they tackle math problems step by step. I think these kinds of channels could have high subscriber counts because the content is educational and engaging for people who want to learn more about math.\n\nI also recall that some channels use math puzzles or challenges as a way to engage viewers, which might attract a lot of subscribers over time. Maybe something like Mr. Pi or Mathadventures? Those seem like they could have high subscriber numbers since they keep adding content regularly.\n\nOn the other hand, some educational channels might focus on more general math topics, which could also reach a significant number of subscribers. There's also the possibility that certain platforms or popular channels attract a lot of subscribers, so I should check those as well.\n\nI'm trying to remember if there are any specific names of channels that have consistently high subscriber counts. From what I can recall, ThinkificallyMath and Mathologer definitely fit the bill because they're well-known for their depth in mathematical topics. Also, Numberphile is another one that's often cited as a favorite among math enthusiasts.\n\nI should also consider if there are any smaller channels or niche ones that might have these stats. For example, some technical channels might be popular due to their content being so specialized but still attract a decent number of subscribers. But I'm not sure how many they reach without specific data.\n\nWait, the user's query is asking for an exhaustive list, so I need to make sure I cover all potential channels that fit this criterion. That includes both popular educational channels and those that focus on math puzzles or challenges. It's also important to note that there might be some channels that don't officially count, but have high subscriber numbers due to their reach through content.\n\nI should double-check the subscriber counts for each channel I'm thinking of. For instance, if someone mentions \"Mathadventures,\" they might have around 500k subscribers because it's a series of daily math challenges. Similarly, Mr. Pi or Mathologer could also cross that threshold with their content.\n\nIn summary, the channels that come to mind are ThinkificallyMath, Mathologer, Numberphile, Mr. Pi, and Mathadventures. These are all well-known for their educational content related to math, which explains why they have a significant subscriber base over 500k.\n</think>\n\nThinkificallyMath, Mathologer, Numberphile, Mr. Pi, and Mathadventures."

They might be a notable editor.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) is another big name in academia and labs. They probably handle funding and policy aspects related to EMMA. Then there's the Department of Energy (DOE), which deals with energy-related policies and innovation, so they could be involved in the program too.\n\nSome private companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft might contribute through their research and R&D efforts.

Then there's Nam Koo from 2012-2018. He was a bit of a controversial figure as he ran for office in a close race.\n\nNext, Moon In-Ho was the PM from 2018 to 2023. That seems like an important time, especially with the economic challenges they were facing after South Korea's debt issues. After that, Joon Hong took over from 2023-2026 and remained until his retirement in 2029.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other PMs during this period that I might have missed.

He got the Nobel Prizes for Physics in 1921 and 1924. That's two awards already. Now, who else has won multiple times? Maybe someone like Linus Pauling or perhaps others?\n\nI think of the list of Nobel laureates. Let me see... John Archibald Wheeler is a name that comes up sometimes for his work in physics, particularly with the Wheeler–Dirac equation and other contributions. That's another Nobel.\n\nThen there's Harlow Shapley, who was known as one of the great theoretical astrophysicists. He won two Nobel Prizes: one in 1928 for Physics and another in 1937 for Chemistry.\n\nWait, what about someone else? Maybe someone from a different field, like literature or art? I believe Albert Einstein also won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954, but he only got it once. So that doesn't count if we're looking for multiple awards.\n\nI'm trying to think of others... maybe someone else in chemistry?

That's two again.\n\nSo putting this all together, the key scientists with more than one Nobel Prize are:\n\n- Albert Einstein: 1921, 1924\n- Linus Pauling: 1905 (if I'm not mixing up dates) and 1937, wait no, actually Pauling won a Peace Prize in 1954. Let me confirm the years.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up. Let's get accurate dates. The Nobel committee for Physics awarded Einstein twice: once in 1921 and again in 1924. For Peace, he got it once in 1954.\n\nFor Linus Pauling, his work in biochemistry led to him receiving two Nobel Prizes: one for Chemistry in 1905 and another in 1937. Or was it different? I think actually he won two in Chemistry each time with the committee.\n\nThen Shapley also got two awards as well. So that's three scientists so far with multiple prizes.\n\nI'm not sure about others, but considering the known list, these are the top ones.
