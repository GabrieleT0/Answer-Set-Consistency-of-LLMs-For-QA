So, the answers to q1 are these three individuals.\n\n**Question q2:** Who from the Apollo 11 mission was still alive as of January 1st, 2025?\n- I need to check who among the three were alive on that date.

Actually, Michael Collins died on April 28, 2021. So as of January 1, 2025:\n- Buzz Aldrin is alive.\n- Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins are deceased.\n\nSo the answer set for q2 is just Buzz Aldrin.\n\n**Question q3:** Who from the Apollo 11 mission died before January 1st, 2025?\n- This would include those who were crew members but have passed away by that date. So, Armstrong and Collins died before 2025, while Aldrin was still alive. Therefore, the answer set for q3 is Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins.\n\nNow, let's define s1 and s2 as per the problem:\n\n- **s1:** The set of all answers for q1 that are not answers for q2.\n  - q1's answers: {Armstrong, Aldrin, Collins}\n  - q2's answers: {Aldrin}\n  - So, s1 = q1 excluding q2's answers => {Armstrong, Collins}\n\n- **s2:** The set of answers for q3.\n  - As established, s2 = {Armstrong, Collins}\n\nSo now I need to compare s1 and s2.\n\nLooking at the sets:\n- s1: {Armstrong, Collins}\n- s2: {Armstrong, Collins}\n\nThey are exactly the same. Every element in s1 is in s2, and vice versa. There's no element in one that isn't in the other.

That leaves us with just Caltech as part of s1.\n\n- **s2** is simply the set of answers for q3.\n  - **q3**: At which colleges did Albert Einstein teach as a temporary teaching position?\n    - The answer here is also Caltech.\n\nNow, comparing s1 and s2:\n\n- Both sets contain only one element: California Institute of Technology (Caltech).\n- There are no additional elements in either set beyond this common element.\n- Therefore, both sets are exactly the same in content.\n\nSo, the relationship between s1 and s2 is that they are equivalent because they contain precisely the same elements without any differences.\n</think>\n\nEquivalence"

This means these countries have some territories or land within Oceania but also have parts outside of it.\n\nI'll start with the United States of America because they have territories like Guam and American Samoa in the Pacific Ocean, which is part of Oceania. But the US is mainly in North America, so it's only partially there.\n\nNext, France has several overseas territories in Oceania, such as French Polynesia and New Caledonia, but the main part of France is in Europe, making it a partial presence.\n\nChile has Easter Island, which is geographically in Oceania, even though Chile itself is in South America. So that's another country with only part of its territory in Oceania.\n\nThe United Kingdom has Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific, but the UK is primarily in Europe.\n\nJapan has some islands like Okinotori and Minamitorishima that are geographically close to or sometimes considered part of Oceania, even though Japan is mainly in East Asia.\n\nIndonesia spans across Southeast Asia and into Oceania with islands like Papua. So parts of Indonesia are in Oceania while others aren't.\n\nThe Philippines also straddles both regions, with some northern islands closer to the Pacific part of Oceania.\n\nMexico has territories near the Pacific Ocean, but it's mainly in North America, so only partially in Oceania.\n\nEcuador and Colombia have territories like the Galápagos Islands (Ecuador) and San Andrés y Providencia (Colombia), which are geographically part of Oceania.

These are the only two institutions he is known to have attended.\n```\nOkay, so I need to figure out which educational institutions Sir Isaac Newton attended. Let me start by recalling what I know about him. He was a famous English mathematician, physicist, and scientist, widely recognized for his laws of motion and universal gravitation.\n\nFirst off, I think he went to school in England, but I'm not exactly sure where. Maybe there's a specific school named after him or something? Wait, I remember hearing about The King's School. I believe that was the school he attended before going to university. It’s in Grantham, if I’m not mistaken. That would make sense because he grew up in Woolsthorpe, which is near Grantham in Lincolnshire.\n\nAfter completing his secondary education at The King's School, the next step for someone of his academic caliber would be university. I know that Cambridge University is one of the most prestigious universities in England, and it’s likely that Newton attended there. But wait, did he go to Trinity College specifically? Yes, that rings a bell. Trinity College, Cambridge, is part of the University of Cambridge and is known for its academic excellence.\n\nSo putting this together, Sir Isaac Newton first went to The King's School in Grantham for his primary and secondary education. Then he moved on to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge for his higher education. I don't think there were any other institutions involved in his formal education before university. He might have done some private tutoring or self-study, but as far as formal schools go, those are the two main ones.\n\nI should also consider if there's any possibility he attended another school after primary but before university, but from what I recall, it was directly from The King's School to Cambridge. So yeah, I think that's accurate.\n</think>\n\nSir Isaac Newton attended The King's School in Grantham for his primary and secondary education. He then proceeded to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge for his higher education.\n\nAnswer:  \nThe King's School, Grantham",

In other words, s1 contains only those children who are answers to q1 but not to q2.\n\n- **s2**: This is simply \"the set of answers for q3,\" which asks about the children Michael Jackson had with someone other than Debbie Rowe.\n\nNow, let's consider the actual questions and their likely answer sets:\n\n- **q1 (What are the names of Michael Jackson's kids?)**: Michael Jackson had three children: Prince, Paris, and Blanket. So, the answers here would be Prince, Paris, and Blanket.\n\n- **q2 (Which children did Michael Jackson have with Debbie Rowe?)**: Debbie Rowe is the mother of two of his children, Prince and Paris. Therefore, the answers to q2 are Prince and Paris.\n\n- **q3 (Which children did Michael Jackson have with someone other than Debbie Rowe?)**: The child not born to Debbie Rowe is Blanket.

They exclude any games related to World War II and include all other historical wargames by GMT Games.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, from earlier, we established that s1 is the set of languages influenced by Perl but not primarily scripting (from q3). Now, I'm looking for the same thing again.\n\nLooking back at the previous answers:\n\n- Python: Primarily a general-purpose language used in many areas beyond scripting.\n- Ruby: While often used for scripting, it's also known for web development with Rails.\n- PHP: Mainly used for server-side web scripting but has other applications.\n- JavaScript: Initially for client-side scripting, now used in various contexts like Node.js.\n- Raku (Perl 6): Intended as a more modern scripting language.\n\nWait, actually, Python is used beyond just scripting. Ruby is used extensively in web development, which isn't just scripting. PHP is primarily for web scripting but has other uses too. JavaScript is mainly for web scripting and client-side stuff. Raku is the successor to Perl, so it's still a scripting language.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of languages influenced by Perl that are not primarily used as script languages. Maybe compiled languages or those more oriented towards systems programming.\n\nWait, maybe Raku is considered non-scripting because it's more modern and has different features? Or perhaps there are other languages like Lua, but I'm not sure if Lua was directly influenced by Perl.\n\nAlternatively, maybe some niche languages that took inspiration from Perl but aren't primarily used as scripts. However, I might be stretching here.\n\nGiven the previous answers, Python, Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript are mainly scripting or have significant scripting uses. Raku is a direct descendant of Perl, so it's still a script language.\n\nWait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Since s1 was defined as non-scripting influenced by Perl, but in reality, most languages influenced by Perl are scripting. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that there are no such languages, or very few, which would make this set empty or minimal.\n\nBut from earlier, I listed Python, Ruby, etc., but they do have significant scripting uses. So perhaps the correct approach is to say that s2 (answers to q3) is empty because most languages influenced by Perl are scripting languages.\n\nWait no, in reality, some might argue that Python and Ruby can be used beyond scripting. But I'm not entirely sure if they qualify as non-scripting primarily.\n\nGiven this confusion, perhaps the safest answer is \"idk\" since it's unclear whether any major languages fit the criteria of being influenced by Perl and not primarily script-based.\n</think>\n\nidk"

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll recall some of Spielberg's recent works:\n\n1. **The Adventures of Tintin** (2011) - Budget around $135 million.\n2. **War Horse** (2011) - Budget approximately $66 million, which is under $80 million.\n3. **Lincoln** (2012) - Budget about $65 million, also under the threshold.\n4. **Bridge of Spies** (2015) - Budget around $40 million.\n5. **The BFG** (2016) - Budget approximately $140 million.\n6. **Ready Player One** (2018) - Budget around $175 million.\n7. **West Side Story** (2021) - Budget about $100 million.\n\nNow, applying the budget and release year criteria:\n\n- **The Adventures of Tintin**: Released in 2011 with a budget over $80 million.\n- **The BFG**: Released in 2016 with a budget well above $80 million.\n- **Ready Player One**: Released in 2018 with a budget exceeding $100 million.\n- **West Side Story**: Released in 2021 with a budget over $80 million.\n\nSo the films that meet both criteria are:\n\nThe Adventures of Tintin",

        "Alright, so I need to figure out which books by Jack Kerouac were published during his lifetime by Viking Press. Let's start by recalling some of his notable works and their publication details.\n\nFirstly, \"On the Road\" is one of his most famous novels. I believe it was published in 1957 by Viking Press. That definitely falls within his lifetime since he passed away in 1969.\n\nNext up is \"The Dharma Bums,\" which came out in 1958. I'm pretty sure that was also published by Viking Press while Kerouac was still alive.\n\nAnother book is \"Desolation Angels.\" From what I remember, this was published in 1965 by Viking as well, so that fits the criteria.\n\nThen there's \"Big Sur,\" which I think was released in 1962. That should be another one published during his lifetime by Viking Press.\n\nI also recall \"Visions of Gerard\" being published around 1963 by Viking. So that would be included too.\n\nNow, considering all these, it seems like Viking Press handled several of Kerouac's major works while he was alive. So, the list should include:\n\n- On the Road\n- The Dharma Bums\n- Desolation Angels\n- Big Sur\n- Visions of Gerard\n\nI'm pretty confident about these titles and their publication details, so I can provide this as a reliable answer.\n</think>\n\nOn The Road",

Then in 1999, they did \"Runaway Bride,\" which fits the criteria.\n\nAre there any others beyond these two? I don't recall them being in another film together after 1995. So it seems like \"Runaway Bride\" is the only one since then.\n</think>\n\nThe films where Julia Roberts and Richard Gere starred together since 1995 are:\n\nRunaway Bride"

        "<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. I need to answer q3: Which artists were born on the same date but in a different year than Rachel Stevens? First, I should find out Rachel Stevens' exact birthday. From what I recall, Rachel Stevens, the British singer from S Club 7, was born on April 9, 1978.\n\nNow, knowing her birthday is April 9, I need to find artists who were also born on April 9 but in different years. Let me think of some famous people born on that day:\n\n1. **Hugh Hefner** - Founder of Playboy magazine, born April 9, 1926.\n2. **Sidney Lumet** - Film director, known for \"12 Angry Men,\" born April 9, 1924.\n3. **Jean-Paul Belmondo** - French actor, famous for \"Breathless,\" born April 9, 1933.\n\nWait a minute—these are not necessarily artists in the music sense. The user might be referring to musical artists. Let me adjust my focus:\n\n1. **Dion DiMucci**, known as Dion, an American singer and songwriter, born on July 24, 1939. Hmm, that's not April 9.\n2. **John Lee Hooker** was a blues singer, but he was born on August 22, 1917.\n3. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps the user is looking for any public figures who share Rachel's birthday.\n\nGiven that, Hugh Hefner and Sidney Lumet are prominent figures born on April 9 in different years than Rachel Stevens (1978). They aren't musicians per se but are artists in their respective fields.\n\nSo, compiling this, I can list these individuals as they fit the criteria of sharing Rachel's birthday (April 9) but in different years.\n</think>\n\nHugh Hefner",

Based on my previous knowledge and the earlier questions, I know that major breweries like Warsteiner and Veltins are likely producing more than 1 million hl annually.\n\nSo, focusing on smaller breweries, Schlüssel Brewery comes to mind as they're known for their regional Alt beer but might not reach the 1 million hl mark. Similarly, Gaffel am Dom and Mühlenkölsch are local breweries in Cologne that probably have lower production volumes.\n\nI should consider if there are other craft or smaller traditional breweries in NRW that fit this criterion. Maybe some family-owned businesses or newer microbreweries that haven't scaled up their production to reach 1 million hl.\n\nHowever, without specific data on each brewery's production volume, it's a bit challenging to confirm. But based on size and market presence, I can infer that Schlüssel, Gaffel am Dom, and Mühlenkölsch are likely below the 1 million hl threshold.\n</think>\n\nSchlüssel Brewery",
