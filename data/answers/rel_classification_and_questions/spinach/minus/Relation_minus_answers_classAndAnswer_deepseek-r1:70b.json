if that's the case, then q1 would have an empty set because there are no us presidents born in 1945.\n\nif q1 is empty, then s1, which is answers to q1 not in q2, would also be empty. similarly, s2, being answers to q3, would also be empty since there are no presidents born in 1945 to begin with.\n\nwait, but that can't be right because the user is asking about these sets, implying that perhaps there are some presidents in them. maybe i'm missing something here.\n\nalternatively, maybe i should consider that perhaps q1 does have answers, but i'm misremembering the birth years of the presidents. let me try to recall or reconstruct:\n\nlet's list us presidents and their birth years:\n\n- george washington: 1732\n- john adams: 1735\n- thomas jefferson: 1743\n- james madison: 1751\n- james monroe: 1758\n- john quincy adams: 1767\n- andrew jackson: 1767\n- martin van buren: 1782\n- william henry harrison: 1773\n- john tyler: 1790\n- james k. polk: 1795\n- zachary taylor: 1784\n- millard fillmore: 1800\n- franklin pierce: 1804\n- james buchanan: 1791\n- abraham lincoln: 1809\n- andrew johnson: 1808\n- ulysses s. grant: 1822\n- rutherford b. hayes: 1822\n- james a. garfield: 1831\n- chester a. arthur: 1829\n- grover cleveland: 1837\n- benjamin harrison: 1833\n- william mckinley: 1843\n- theodore roosevelt: 1858\n- william howard taft: 1857\n- woodrow wilson: 1856\n- warren g. harding: 1865\n- calvin coolidge: 1872\n- herbert hoover: 1874\n- franklin d. roosevelt: 1882\n- harry s. truman: 1884\n- dwight d. eisenhower: 1890\n- john f. kennedy: 1917\n- lyndon b. johnson: 1908\n- richard nixon: 1913\n- gerald ford: 1913\n- jimmy carter: 1924\n- ronald reagan: 1911\n- george h.w. bush: 1924\n- bill clinton: 1946\n- george w. bush: 1946\n- barack obama: 1961\n- donald trump: 1946\n- joe biden: 1942\n\nwait, from this list, i don't see any us president born in 1945. the closest are bill clinton, george w. bush, and donald trump, all born in 1946. joe biden was born in 1942, which is before 1945.\n\nso that would mean that the answer set for q1 is empty because no us presidents were born in 1945. therefore, s1, being the answers to q1 not in q2, would also be empty since there are no elements in q1 to begin with.\n\nsimilarly, s2, which is the set of answers to q3 (presidents born in 1945 elected in or after 2000), would also be empty because there are none.\n\nif both s1 and s2 are empty sets, then their relationship would be one of equivalence because two empty sets are logically equivalent. alternatively, sometimes empty sets can be considered disjoint as well, but i think the correct term here is equivalence since they have exactly the same elements (none).\n\nwait, but maybe i'm missing a president born in 1945. let me double-check. perhaps someone like john f. kennedy was born earlier, but he's 1917. wait, no, that's not it. maybe someone else? hmm.\n\nalternatively, perhaps i should consider that there are indeed no presidents born in 1945, so both s1 and s2 would be empty sets, making them equivalent.\n</think>\n\nthe relationship between s1 and s2 is one of equivalence because both are empty sets as there are no us presidents born in 1945.\n\nequivalence"

i think he did write *the anthropocene reviewed*, which is a collection of essays, so that's non-fiction.\n\nso q1 includes all his books except *the fault in our stars*. so the answer set for q1 would include both fiction and non-fiction works.\n\nnext, **q2**: \"what other fiction books have been written by the author of the fault in our stars?\"\n\nthis is similar to q1 but specifically asking for fiction books. so, the answer set here would exclude any non-fiction books john green has written. from what i know, his non-fiction work is *the anthropocene reviewed*. so, q2's answer set would include all the fiction books: *looking for alaska*, *an abundance of katherines*, *paper towns*, *turtles all the way down*, and possibly his part in *let it snow*.\n\nnow, **q3**: \"what non-fiction books have been written by the author of the fault in our stars before 2010?\"\n\nso this is specifically about non-fiction books by john green before 2010. from what i know, john green's major works are fiction, and his non-fiction work *the anthropocene reviewed* was published in 2020, which is after 2010. before 2010, i don't recall him publishing any non-fiction books. he might have written essays or articles, but i'm not sure if he had a book before that.\n\nso, putting it all together:\n\n- **s1** = q1 answers minus q2 answers. since q1 includes both fiction and non-fiction, subtracting the fiction (q2) would leave only the non-fiction books by john green. so s1 is {the anthropocene reviewed} or maybe empty if he didn't have any non-fiction before 2010.\n\nwait, but in q3, it's asking for non-fiction before 2010. if *the anthropocene reviewed* was published in 2020, then before 2010, john green might not have any non-fiction books. so s1 would be the set of non-fiction books by him that are answers to q1 but not in q2. but if he didn't write any non-fiction before 2010, then s1 would actually include *the anthropocene reviewed*, right? wait no, because q3 is specifically about before 2010. so maybe i'm confusing the timelines.\n\nwait, let's clarify:\n\n- q1: all books except the fault in our stars (both fiction and non-fiction).\n- q2: all fiction books except the fault in our stars.\n- therefore, s1 = q1 - q2 = all non-fiction books by john green.\n  \nbut if john green didn't write any non-fiction before 2010, then s1 would include *the anthropocene reviewed* only if it's after 2010. but the question is about before 2010 for q3.\n\nso, let me re-express:\n\n- **s1** consists of all books by john green that are not in q2 (i.e., non-fiction). so s1 would include *the anthropocene reviewed* and any other non-fiction he might have written, but from what i know, he only has that one.\n\n- **s2** is the answer set for q3: non-fiction books by john green before 2010. since *the anthropocene reviewed* was published in 2020, s2 would be empty because there are no non-fiction books by him before 2010.\n\ntherefore:\n\n- s1 = {the anthropocene reviewed}\n- s2 = {}\n\nnow, comparing these two sets:\n\ns1 is a set containing one element, while s2 is an empty set. so, how do they relate?\n\nin terms of set relations, the possible options are equivalence, contains, containedby, disjoint, overlap, or unknown.\n\nsince s2 is empty, it can't contain any elements from s1. therefore, there's no overlap because s2 has nothing to overlap with. the two sets don't share any common elements; in fact, one is empty and the other isn't. so they are disjoint because they have no elements in common.\n\nwait, but s1 has an element that s2 doesn't have. but since s2 is empty, all its elements (none) are also in s1? hmm, actually, the definition of disjoint is that their intersection is empty. since s2 is empty, the intersection between s1 and s2 is indeed empty. therefore, they are disjoint.\n\nso the relation is disjoint.\n</think>\n\ndisjoint"
