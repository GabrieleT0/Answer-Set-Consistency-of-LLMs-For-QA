    "58": "<think>\nalright, so i've got these two questions here: q1 is asking \"which buildings are functionalist?\" and q2 is \"which buildings exemplify functionalism?\" the task is to figure out how their answer sets relate logically. let me break this down step by step.\n\nfirst off, i need to understand what each question is really getting at. functionalism in architecture refers to a design approach where the building's purpose and function are prioritized over aesthetics. so when someone asks about functionalist buildings, they're looking for structures that follow this principle.\n\nnow, q1 uses the term \"are functionalist,\" which seems pretty straightforward. it's asking directly about buildings that fit into the functionalist category. on the other hand, q2 is phrased as \"exemplify functionalism.\" to exemplify means to serve as a typical example or to represent something clearly.\n\ni'm thinking about whether there's a difference between saying a building \"is functionalist\" and one that \"exemplifies functionalism.\" at first glance, they seem very similar. both are identifying buildings that embody the principles of functionalism. but maybe there's a nuance here.\n\ncould it be that \"exemplify\" implies a stronger representation? like, not just any building that follows functionalism but those that are prime examples or showcase it particularly well? if that's the case, then q2 might be looking for a subset of buildings that are considered model cases of functionalism. in contrast, q1 could include all such buildings, whether they're exemplary or just standard examples.\n\nso if i break it down:\n- q1: all buildings that follow functionalist principles.\n- q2: buildings that are prime or significant examples of functionalism.\n\nif this is true, then every answer to q2 should also be an answer to q1 because to exemplify functionalism means they are indeed functionalist buildings. however, q1 might have more buildings that don't necessarily stand out as exemplary models but still adhere to the principles.\n\ntherefore, all answers to q2 would be included in q1's answers, but q1 has additional buildings not covered by q2. that fits the \"contains\" relation where q1 ⊃ q2.\n</think>\n\nthe answer sets of q1 and q2 are such that every building exemplifying functionalism is also a functionalist building, but there may be more functionalist buildings beyond those that exemplify it.\n\ncontains",

maybe including t20 or other formats? let me think. the term \"cricket world cup\" can sometimes be used more broadly to encompass all forms of the game, but typically when someone refers to the cricket world cup without specifying, they're talking about the 50-over (odi) tournament. however, it's possible that some people might interpret q1 as including all types of world cups in cricket, like t20, test matches, etc.\n\nbut looking at q2: \"which countries have won a world cup in cricket?\" the phrasing here is slightly different, but i don't think it changes the scope. it's still asking for countries that have won any world cup competition in cricket, which would include both odi and t20 formats if applicable.\n\nnow, considering the answer sets: for q1, if someone answers with all countries that have ever won any cricket world cup (including odi and t20), then q2 should yield the same set of countries. conversely, if they only consider one format, but since both questions don't specify, it's reasonable to assume they're asking about all formats.\n\nhowever, is there a possibility that some people might interpret \"cricket world cup\" as only referring to the odi tournament? if that's the case, then q1 would include countries like australia, india, west indies, etc., who have won the odi world cup. but if someone interprets it more broadly, they might also include teams that have won the t20 world cup, such as pakistan, england, sri lanka, etc.\n\nbut wait, in reality, some countries have won both the odi and t20 world cups, so their inclusion wouldn't change much, but others might have only won one or the other. for example, eoin morgan's england won the 2019 odi world cup, but also, england has a separate team that won the t20 world cup in 2021. so if someone includes both tournaments in their answer for q1, then countries like england would be counted once, regardless of which format they won.\n\nbut let me check: does \"cricket world cup\" refer exclusively to odi? or is it a broader term that can include t20 as well? i think the more precise terms are \"icc cricket world cup\" for the odi and \"icc t20 world cup\" for the shorter format. so when someone says \"cricket world cup,\" they might be referring specifically to the odi tournament, whereas \"world cup in cricket\" could potentially include all forms.\n\nbut that's a bit of a stretch because both questions are phrased similarly enough that most people would treat them as asking for the same set of countries. unless someone interprets q2 differently, but i don't see why they would. both are clearly about winning a world cup in cricket.\n\nanother angle: are there any countries that have won a \"world cup in cricket\" that haven't won a \"cricket world cup\"? or vice versa? well, if \"world cup in cricket\" is broader and includes more competitions, like the t20 world cup or even women's tournaments, then perhaps q2's answer set might include more countries than q1. for example, australia has won both odi and t20 men's world cups, so they'd be included in both. but a country that has only won the t20 world cup but not the odi one would be included in q2 if it's interpreted as including all formats.\n\nwait, does the term \"cricket world cup\" ever refer to women's cricket? because there is a women's cricket world cup. so maybe someone could interpret q1 as including both men's and women's tournaments, whereas q2 might only refer to men's. or perhaps not—maybe they're both gender-neutral.\n\nthis is getting complicated. let me try to simplify. the key point is whether the two questions are asking about exactly the same set of competitions or if one includes more than the other.\n\nif we assume that both questions are asking for all countries that have ever won any form of cricket world cup, then their answer sets would be identical. therefore, the relation would be equivalence.\n\nhowever, if \"cricket world cup\" in q1 is interpreted as only the odi tournament, and \"world cup in cricket\" in q2 includes both odi and t20 (or other formats), then q2's answer set could include more countries than q1. that would mean that q1's answers are a subset of q2's, so the relation would be containedby.\n\nbut wait, is there any indication that one question is broader? the way they're phrased, both seem to refer to the same general concept of winning a world cup in cricket. unless someone takes \"cricket world cup\" as only odi, and \"world cup in cricket\" as including more formats, but i don't think there's a standard that would make that distinction.\n\nto double-check, let me consider some examples:\n\n- countries that have won the odi world cup: australia, india, west indies, sri lanka, pakistan, england.\n- countries that have won the t20 world cup: same as above plus perhaps some others like south africa or new zealand? wait, no, i think those countries haven't won the t20 yet. let me confirm:\n\nactually, the icc men's t20 world cup winners include india (2007), pakistan (2009), england (2010), west indies (2012, 2016), sri lanka (2014), australia (2021). so the same set of countries have won both odi and t20 tournaments. therefore, if q1 includes all formats, then their answer sets would still be the same.\n\nunless a country has only won in one format but not the other, which i don't think is the case for any country so far.\n\nwait, no—what about teams that have only won the t20 world cup and not the odi?

    "147": "<think>\nokay, so i'm trying to figure out the relationship between the answers to these two questions about south korea's prime ministers over the past 20 years. let me break it down step by step.\n\nfirst, let's look at q1: \"who has served as prime minister of south korea in the past 20 years?\" this question is asking for individuals who have held that position during that time frame.\n\nthen there's q2: \"name all south korean prime ministers from the past 20 years.\" this one seems pretty similar, but it's phrased slightly differently. it's also asking for a list of people who served as pm in the same period.\n\nat first glance, both questions are about identifying the same group of people—those who were prime ministers in south korea over the last 20 years. they're essentially seeking the exact same information but just worded differently. one is asking \"who has served\" and the other is asking to \"name all,\" but they both refer to the same role and time frame.\n\ni don't see any indication that one question is broader or narrower than the other. they both seem to be targeting the exact same set of individuals without any additional criteria. there's no mention of specific policies, terms, or other factors that might make one question more inclusive or exclusive than the other.\n\nso, if i consider the possible relations: equivalence seems to fit because both questions are asking for the same list of people. there doesn't seem to be any overlap where some answers would be in one but not the other. they’re not disjoint either since they cover the same group. the \"containedby\" or \"contains\" relationships don’t apply here because neither is a subset of the other; they're the same set.\n\ntherefore, the most appropriate relationship between the answer sets of q1 and q2 is equivalence.\n</think>\n\nequivalence",
    "148": "<think>\nokay, let me try to figure out how these two questions relate in terms of their answer sets. so, q1 is asking who has won more than one type of nobel prize, and q2 is about who has won multiple types of nobel prizes. at first glance, they seem similar because both are referring to individuals who have received nobel prizes in more than one category.\n\ni know that the word \"multiple\" generally means more than one, so in this context, \"more than one type\" and \"multiple types\" are essentially saying the same thing. the nobel prize categories include physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economic sciences. someone like marie curie comes to mind because she won both physics and chemistry nobels.\n\ni'm trying to think if there's any nuance i might be missing. maybe \"more than one\" could sometimes imply exactly two, while \"multiple\" might mean three or more in some contexts? but in standard usage, especially in questions like these, they're used interchangeably without such strict numerical distinctions.\n\nso, the set of people who have won more than one type should be identical to those who have won multiple types. there aren't any additional cases where someone could fall into one category but not the other based on how these terms are typically understood.\n\ni don't see any reason why one would include extra individuals that the other doesn't, or why there would be an overlap without full containment either way. they seem to cover exactly the same ground. therefore, the answer sets should be equivalent.\n</think>\n\nequivalence",
    "149": "<think>\nokay, so i need to figure out the logical relationship between the answer sets of q1 and q2. the questions are about the 1972 u.s. presidential election candidates. let me break this down step by step.\n\nfirst, i'll look at what each question is asking. q1 asks, \"who were the candidates in the 1972 united states presidential election?\" while q2 asks, \"who ran in the 1972 u.s. presidential election?\" on the surface, they seem very similar because both are about who participated in that election.\n\ni know that in general, \"candidates\" and \"ran\" can sometimes be used interchangeably in the context of elections. candidates are people who run for office, so when someone runs, they become a candidate. therefore, it's likely that the answer sets would include the same individuals.\n\nnow, i should consider if there are any nuances where these terms might not overlap perfectly. for example, sometimes people announce their candidacy but don't actually run, or there might be technicalities like write-in candidates. however, in the context of a specific election year, especially one as historically significant as 1972, the major candidates would have both run and been recognized as candidates.\n\ni'll think about who ran in 1972. the main candidates were richard nixon (republican), george mcgovern (democratic), and there were also some third-party candidates like john hospers and others. i don't recall any significant differences between who \"ran\" and who were considered \"candidates.\" they're essentially the same group of people.\n\nsince both questions are phrased to include all participants in that election, their answer sets should be identical. there's no indication that one would exclude someone the other includes or vice versa. therefore, the logical relationship is equivalence because they share exactly the same set of answers.\n</think>\n\nthe most appropriate relation is:\n\nequivalence"
