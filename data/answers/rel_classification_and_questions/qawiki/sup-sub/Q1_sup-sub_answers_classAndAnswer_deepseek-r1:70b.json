They're famous for their flat tops and steep sides, often creating isolated ecosystems.\n\nThe first question asks for all countries where tepuis are located. From my knowledge, the main countries include Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. These nations are part of the Guiana Shield, a region in South America known for these formations.\n\nVenezuela is renowned for having many tepuis, including the famous one housing Angel Falls. Brazil also has several, though they might be less well-known internationally.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to answer where I can see El Greco's paintings in museums. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, El Greco was a Greek painter who was active in Spain, especially in Toledo. So it makes sense that many of his works are in Spanish museums. The most famous one is the Museo del Greco in Toledo, which is dedicated to him and has several of his paintings.\n\nAnother major museum with his work is the Prado Museum in Madrid. I know they have a significant collection of his paintings, including \"The Disrobing of Christ\" and \"The Holy Trinity.\" These are some of his most famous works, so that's a key location.\n\nThen there's the Queen Sofia Museum, also in Madrid, which has modern art but sometimes includes El Greco's pieces. I'm not entirely sure if they have any on permanent display or just temporary exhibitions, though.\n\nI should consider other Spanish cities too. The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid is part of the Golden Triangle of Art and might have some of his works as well. They cover a broad range of European art, so it's possible.\n\nOutside of Spain, I'm thinking about where else El Greco's paintings can be found. The Louvre in Paris has an extensive collection but I'm not certain if they have any of his pieces. I believe most of his work is in Spain since he was based there for much of his career.\n\nIn the United States, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City likely has some of his paintings. They have a large European art section, and El Greco is a prominent figure, so that's a good bet.\n\nI should also think about other major museums like the National Gallery in London or the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Do they have any El Greco pieces? I'm not entirely sure, but it wouldn't be surprising if they did, given his influence and fame.\n\nWait, focusing back on Spain, there's also the Cathedral of Toledo itself, which houses some of his works. While technically a cathedral, it functions as a museum in many ways because of its art collection. So that might be another location to include.\n\nI should double-check if any other notable museums have his paintings. For example, the Art Institute of Chicago or the Getty Museum in Los Angeles—do they have El Greco pieces? I'm not certain, but it's possible given their extensive collections.\n\nIn summary, the main museums are definitely Museo del Greco in Toledo and the Prado Museum in Madrid. The others like Queen Sofia, Thyssen-Bornemisza, and perhaps some international museums might also have his works. To be thorough, I should list all these possibilities.\n</think>\n\nMuseo del Greco in Toledo",

I should list them from the biggest to the tenth. Then, q2 wants just the largest one, which should be the first country in my list for q1.\n\nI'll start by recalling or looking up the African countries ordered by their land area. Algeria is the largest, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Then Sudan, though I remember that South Sudan split from it, so maybe Sudan's size is different now? Hmm, perhaps I should confirm that. Anyway, moving on: Libya, Chad, Niger, Angola, Mali, and Mauritania are usually in the top 10.\n\nWait, I might be mixing up some of them. Let me make sure I get the order right because accuracy matters here. After Algeria, DR Congo is indeed second. Then comes Sudan, which includes both North and South, but since they split, maybe the combined area is still considered? Or does it refer to each separately now? This could affect the list.\n\nI think for simplicity, Sudan as a single entity is often still listed among the top. So continuing: Libya, Chad, Niger, Angola, Mali, Mauritania, and then perhaps Ethiopia or another country. I might need to double-check this order because sometimes countries like Ethiopia have significant areas too.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with the list I have in mind, making sure each is correctly placed.

First off, I know that G20 stands for \"Group of Twenty.\" It's an international forum that includes some of the world's leading economies. But wait, is it just twenty countries? Or does the name refer to something else?\n\nI remember hearing that the G20 was established in 1999, but maybe that's when it started as a finance ministers' group. I think it became more prominent after the 2008 financial crisis when they held summits at the leaders' level. So, the G20 includes both developed and developing economies, which makes sense because it's meant to represent a broader range of economic powers.\n\nNow, trying to list all the member countries... I'm pretty sure the United States is part of it. Then there's Canada and Mexico from North America. Moving across the Atlantic, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and probably Spain? Wait, no, Spain isn't a permanent member. Let me think—maybe it's an invited guest sometimes.\n\nLooking at Asia, I know Japan is in the G20. Then there's China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, and Russia. Oh, wait, Russia's been a bit of a wildcard lately with all the sanctions, but as far as I remember, they're still part of the G20. Australia is also included from the Pacific region.\n\nIn Africa, South Africa represents the continent in the G20. Then there are some European countries like Germany, France, Italy, the UK, and maybe others. Wait, let me not forget Turkey and Saudi Arabia—they should be part of it too. Also, Brazil and Argentina from South America. Oh, and I think the European Union is also represented, but that's more of a regional bloc rather than individual countries.\n\nWait a second, I'm listing more than twenty entities here. Let me recount to make sure I don't exceed twenty. The G20 includes 19 countries plus the EU, making it 20 members in total. So, each member country plus the EU as a single entity brings the total count appropriately.\n\nLet me list them again to ensure accuracy: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Union. That's 20 members in total.\n\nI should double-check if any countries have joined or left recently.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out what proteins are found in dendrites. Dendrites are parts of neurons that receive synaptic inputs from other neurons, right? So, they must have various proteins that help them function properly.\n\nFirst off, there are ion channels. These are crucial because they allow ions to flow in and out of the cell, which is essential for generating electrical signals. I think sodium and potassium channels are key here since they play a big role in action potentials.\n\nThen there are neurotransmitter receptors. Since dendrites receive signals from other neurons through neurotransmitters, they must have receptors like NMDA receptors or AMPA receptors to bind these chemicals. These receptors help in synaptic transmission.\n\nSignaling proteins also come to mind. Proteins like kinases and phosphatases are involved in signal transduction pathways within the neuron. They help process the signals received by the dendrites and can lead to changes in the neuron's excitability or gene expression.\n\nCytoskeletal proteins must be present too. The cytoskeleton provides structure and support, so proteins like actin and tubulin are probably there, helping maintain the shape of the dendrites and aiding in transport processes.\n\nAdhesion molecules might also be important. They help neurons stick together and form connections, so something like cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) could be part of this list.\n\nScaffolding proteins are another category. They help organize other proteins into complexes, ensuring proper signaling. Examples might include PSD-95, which is known to cluster receptors and signaling molecules at synapses.\n\nTransport proteins shouldn't be overlooked either. Proteins like kinesin and dynein are involved in moving vesicles and materials along the axon and dendrites, so they're likely present.\n\nLastly, regulatory proteins that control protein synthesis or degradation would be necessary for maintaining the health and functionality of the dendrites. These could include ubiquitin ligases or proteasomal components.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the list includes ion channels, receptors, signaling proteins, cytoskeletal elements, adhesion molecules, scaffolding proteins, transporters, and regulatory proteins.\n</think>\n\nIon channels",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what proteins are involved in retina homeostasis. Hmm, that sounds like it's about how the retina maintains its normal function and structure. Proteins play a huge role in various biological processes, so there must be several key players here.\n\nFirst, I think about photoreceptors because they're essential for vision. Proteins like rhodopsin come to mind; it's crucial for light detection. Then there are the proteins involved in signal transduction, such as transducin and cGMP phosphodiesterase, which help convert the light signal into electrical signals.\n\nI also remember reading about structural proteins that maintain the retina's integrity. Maybe something like actin or tubulin, which are part of the cytoskeleton. They help keep cells shaped properly and facilitate transport within the cell.\n\nWhat about enzymes involved in the visual cycle? Proteins like RPE65 in the retinal pigment epithelium help recycle rhodopsin after it's been activated by light. Without these, photoreceptors wouldn't function properly.\n\nTransport proteins are another category—proteins that move ions or molecules across cell membranes. For example, ion channels and pumps, such as Na+/K+ ATPase, maintain the ionic balance necessary for neural signaling in the retina.\n\nGrowth factors might also be involved. Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is important for angiogenesis, but I'm not sure if it's directly related to homeostasis. Maybe more about maintaining the retinal vasculature.\n\nAntioxidant proteins could play a role too, protecting against oxidative stress which is crucial in the retina due to high light exposure. Something like superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase might be relevant.\n\nI should also consider specific retinal diseases and the proteins implicated in them. For instance, mutations in the ABCA4 gene are linked to Stargardt disease, affecting protein function critical for retinal health.\n\nPutting this all together, there's a diverse set of proteins involved in maintaining retina homeostasis, ranging from structural support to signal transduction and protection against stress.\n</think>\n\nThe proteins involved in retina homeostasis include rhodopsin, transducin, cGMP phosphodiesterase, actin, tubulin, RPE65, Na+/K+ ATPase, VEGF, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and ABCA4."

From what I know, several religions have teachings or practices that encourage followers to avoid eating meat. \n\nFirst, Hinduism comes to mind because many Hindus are vegetarians due to their belief in ahimsa, which is non-violence towards all living beings. They believe in reincarnation and the idea of not harming animals.\n\nThen there's Jainism, which takes this a step further by not only avoiding meat but also root vegetables and sometimes even certain types of plant-based foods. Jains follow an extremely strict form of vegetarianism called veganism, avoiding any food that might involve harm to living organisms.\n\nBuddhism is another religion where vegetarianism is common, though it's not always a requirement for all Buddhists. Some Buddhist traditions encourage a vegetarian diet as part of practicing compassion and reducing suffering.\n\nI also recall that some branches of Christianity promote vegetarianism, especially groups like Seventh-day Adventists who might follow specific dietary rules for health and spiritual reasons.\n\nSikhism has some followers who are vegetarian, though I'm not entirely sure if it's a central tenet or just a common practice among many Sikhs.\n\nThere are other smaller religious communities as well that emphasize vegetarianism as part of their teachings or lifestyle choices. For example, certain sects within Islam might encourage avoiding excess meat consumption, although it's not a strict requirement.\n\nSo putting this all together, the religions I can think of that promote vegetarianism include Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, some branches of Christianity like Seventh-day Adventists, Sikhism, and various smaller religious groups with specific dietary traditions.\n</think>\n\nHinduism",

Let me try to list some names:\n\n1. **Kylian Mbappé** - He was born in France to a Cameroonian father and an Algerian mother, so he might hold French, Cameroonian, and Algerian citizenships.\n2. **Paul Pogba** - Born in France to Guinean parents, so he likely holds both French and Guinean citizenships.\n3. **Cristiano Ronaldo** - From Portugal, but having played for clubs in England, Spain, Italy, and possibly holding multiple residencies, though not necessarily multiple citizenships beyond Portuguese.\n4. **Neymar Jr.** - Born in Brazil but has played in Europe; I'm not sure if he holds dual citizenship.\n5. **Zlatan Ibrahimović** - Born in Sweden to a Bosnian father and Croatian mother, so possibly holds Swedish, Bosnian, and Croatian citizenships.\n6. **Mesut Özil** - German-Turkish heritage, likely holding both citizenships.\n7. **Mikel Arteta** - Spanish, but as a manager in England, not sure about his citizenship status.\n\nWait, some of these might be speculative. I'm not entirely certain about each player's exact citizenships. It would be more accurate to stick with known dual citizens:\n\n- **Thierry Henry**: French and Belgian.\n- **Patrick Vieira**: French and Senegalese.\n- **Robin van Persie**: Dutch and Moroccan.\n\nBut again, without specific information, I'm not entirely sure if these players hold multiple citizenships. It's possible that some do, but others might not. Therefore, the best answer is to state that I don't know the exact list of players with at least two citizenships.\n</think>\n\nThe AI should return \"idk\" as it cannot provide a definitive list without specific knowledge.\n\nidk"

        "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out which carbon isotopes can recursively decay into boron isotopes. Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First off, I know that isotopes are variants of elements with different numbers of neutrons. Carbon has several isotopes, like Carbon-12, Carbon-13, and Carbon-14, but those are stable or have very long half-lives. Wait, the question is about decaying into boron, so maybe we're looking at radioactive isotopes.\n\nI remember that radioactive decay can happen in different ways—alpha, beta, gamma, etc. Alpha decay involves emitting an alpha particle (helium nucleus), which reduces the atomic number by 2 and the mass number by 4. Beta decay involves emitting a beta particle (electron), increasing the atomic number by 1 but leaving the mass number unchanged.\n\nSo, carbon has an atomic number of 6. Boron is next to it with an atomic number of 5. Wait, that doesn't make sense because moving from carbon to boron would decrease the atomic number, which isn't possible through beta decay since that increases the atomic number. So maybe alpha decay? If a carbon isotope undergoes alpha decay, its atomic number decreases by 2, so from 6 to 4, which would be beryllium, not boron.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Let's consider different isotopes of carbon and see if any can decay into boron through some process.\n\nCarbon-8: Wait, does that exist? I think Carbon-8 might be too unstable. If it undergoes beta decay, it would go to nitrogen, which has an atomic number of 7. But that’s not boron. Maybe other isotopes?\n\nAlternatively, maybe neutron-rich isotopes could undergo different decays. For example, if a carbon isotope captures neutrons or something... Wait, but in natural decay processes, the options are limited.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again: Carbon has atomic number 6; boron is 5. So to go from 6 to 5, the nucleus must lose a proton or gain an electron (in beta plus decay). But wait, in beta plus decay, a proton converts into a neutron, emitting a positron, which would decrease the atomic number by 1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if any carbon isotopes undergo beta plus decay to become boron. Let me check my knowledge: Carbon-11 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 20 minutes. It decays via beta decay, but wait, beta decay increases the atomic number, so Carbon-11 (atomic number 6) would decay into Nitrogen-11 (atomic number 7), not boron.\n\nCarbon-10: I'm not sure if that's stable or not. Maybe it doesn't exist in significant quantities. Alternatively, maybe some higher isotopes? Or perhaps the question is about cluster decay or something more exotic?\n\nWait a second—maybe the confusion comes from the fact that carbon generally decays into nitrogen via beta decay, not boron. So perhaps there are no carbon isotopes that can directly decay into boron through standard decay modes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's possible through some other process like proton emission, but I'm not sure if any known carbon isotopes undergo proton emission to become boron. Let me think: Proton emission would reduce the atomic number by 1, so from 6 (carbon) to 5 (boron). Is there a carbon isotope that emits a proton?\n\nI don't recall specific examples of carbon isotopes that decay via proton emission into boron. Most of the lighter elements typically undergo beta or alpha decay.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is that no carbon isotopes can recursively decay into boron isotopes under standard radioactive decay processes. Therefore, the list would be empty.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again: Are there any known cases where a carbon isotope decays into boron? Maybe through some less common decay mode or via capture processes?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in some nuclear reactions, not just natural decay, but that's outside the scope of typical radioactive decay.\n\nSo, based on my current understanding, I don't think there are any carbon isotopes that can decay into boron. Therefore, the answer would be an empty list.\n</think>\n\nThe carbon isotopes that can recursively decay into boron isotopes are:\n\nCarbon-8",
        "Carbon-9",
        "Carbon-10",
        "... (as per specific known decay chains if any exist)\n\nHowever, based on my thought process, it appears there may not be any such isotopes through standard decay processes.\n\nAI: Carbon-11 decays into Boron-11 via beta plus decay. But wait, no—Carbon has atomic number 6, so beta plus decay would go to atomic number 5, which is boron. So actually, Carbon-11 can decay into Boron-11 via positron emission (beta plus decay).\n\nSo the correct answer should include Carbon-11.\n\nTherefore:\n\nCarbon-11\n\nBut in my earlier thinking, I had confusion but ultimately realized that Carbon-11 decays to Boron-11 via beta plus decay. So the list is:\n\nCarbon-11"

The Sicilian Defence is one of the most popular and aggressive openings for Black against 1.e4. It starts with the moves 1.e4 c5. There are several main variations, each with its own sub-variations.\n\nFirst, there's the Open Sicilian, which involves an early exchange of pawns leading to sharp play. Within this category, some well-known lines include:\n\n- The Najdorf Variation: One of the most aggressive and theoretical lines, starting with 5...a6.\n- The Dragon Variation: Known for its fianchetto setup on the kingside, starting with 5...g6.\n- The Sveshnikov Variation: A solid line where Black plays 5...e5, challenging White's center immediately.\n\nThen there are the Anti-Sicilian lines, which are variations that don't lead to the Open Sicilian. These include:\n\n- The Alapin Variation: Starting with 2.c3, aiming for a quick d4 push.\n- The Closed Sicilian: Involving 2.Nc3 and 3.g3, leading to a more closed center.\n- The Smith-Morra Gambit: A gambit line where White offers a pawn with 2.b3 and 3.c3.\n\nAdditionally, there are other less common variations like the Hedgehog System and various other setups that fall under the Sicilian umbrella.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which countries are named after plants. Let's start brainstorming. First off, some country names might be directly derived from plant names. For example, \"Ireland\" comes to mind because it's derived from the word for \"land of Ireland,\" but that's more about geography than a specific plant. Wait, no, actually, \"Ireland\" is named after the goddess Ériu, not a plant.\n\nLet me think again. There's \"Papua New Guinea,\" but I'm not sure if Papua refers to a plant. Maybe it's from the term for the local people or something else. Hmm.\n\nWait, there are countries like \"Timor-Leste.\" The word \"timor\" might be related to a type of tree or plant? Or maybe it's just a geographical term. I'm not certain about that either.\n\nAnother thought: some countries have names that include words for trees or flowers in their languages. For example, \"Sri Lanka\" has \"sri,\" which means \"holy\" or \"resplendent,\" but not necessarily a plant. Similarly, \"Samoa\" comes from the Polynesian word for \"sacred center,\" again not a plant.\n\nWait, what about \"Ghana\"? The name Ghana is derived from an ancient empire and doesn't directly relate to plants. Similarly, \"Kenya\" is named after Mount Kenya, which is a geological feature rather than a plant.\n\nI'm struggling to think of countries whose names are directly derived from specific plants. Maybe smaller island nations? For example, \"Vanuatu\" comes from the word meaning \"land eternal,\" but that's not a plant either.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider countries where the name is metaphorically linked to plants or where the country is known for certain flora. But that might be stretching it beyond direct naming.\n\nI'm starting to think that there aren't many, if any, countries directly named after plants. Most country names are derived from geographical features, historical empires, cultural terms, or other non-botanical sources.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is that no countries are explicitly named after plants.\n</think>\n\nThe list of countries named after plants appears to be nonexistent based on my current knowledge.\n\nidk"

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which countries border South Sudan and then determine how that relates to the second question about which neighboring country borders the most countries. \n\nFirst, for q1, \"Which countries border South Sudan?\", I remember that South Sudan is a landlocked country in East Africa. It gained independence from Sudan in 2011, so Sudan is definitely one of its neighbors. Then, looking around, Ethiopia is to the northeast, Kenya to the southeast, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are southward, and Central African Republic (CAR) is to the west.\n\nSo, listing them out: Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, DRC, and CAR. That makes six countries in total.\n\nNow for q2, \"What country that borders South Sudan borders the most countries?\" I need to determine which of these six neighbors has the highest number of adjacent countries themselves.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. **Sudan**: Borders Egypt, Libya, Chad, Central African Republic (CAR), South Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea. That’s 7 countries.\n2. **Ethiopia**: Neighbors are Somalia, Djibouti, Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya. So, 6 countries.\n3. **Kenya**: Borders Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Uganda, Tanzania. That's 5 countries.\n4. **Uganda**: Neighbors include South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Rwanda, Tanzania, Kenya. Also 5 countries.\n5. **Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)**: This one is a bit tricky because DRC has multiple neighbors. Let me think: It borders Central African Republic, South Sudan, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia, Angola, Republic of the Congo. Wait, that's 9 countries.\n6. **Central African Republic (CAR)**: Borders Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Cameroon, Gabon. That’s 7 countries.\n\nWait a second, I thought DRC borders nine countries, which would make it the most among all neighbors of South Sudan. But earlier, I considered that CAR and Sudan both border seven each, while DRC might actually have more. So if DRC has nine, that's higher than the others.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm overcounting for DRC? Let me recount: \n\n- Central African Republic\n- South Sudan\n- Uganda\n- Rwanda\n- Burundi\n- Tanzania\n- Zambia\n- Angola\n- Republic of the Congo\n\nYes, that's nine. So actually, DRC would be the country neighboring South Sudan with the most countries.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes sources might vary on exact counts due to territorial disputes or different definitions of borders. But based on my knowledge, DRC has the most neighbors among those six countries.\n\nSo, the answer to q2 is Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nNow, looking back at the logical relationship between q1 and q2: q1's answers are Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic. q2's answer is just one country: Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nTherefore, all answers to q2 (which is a single country) are included in q1's set of answers. But q1 has more answers beyond what's in q2. So the relation is that the answer set of q2 is contained within the answer set of q1.\n\nThe appropriate relationship from the list provided would be \"ContainedBy\".\n</think>\n\nThe answer sets of q1 and q2 have a ContainedBy relationship because all answers to q2 are also answers to q1, but q1 has additional answers.\n\nContainedBy"

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to find all countries that changed their driving side from left to right. Let's think about historical examples where countries switched from driving on the left to the right side of the road. \n\nFirst off, I remember that many former British colonies used to drive on the left because of British influence but later switched to the right. A notable example is Sweden, which made the change in 1967. They switched from left-hand traffic to right-hand traffic on September 3rd of that year.\n\nThen there's Iceland, which also changed from driving on the left to the right in 1968. Similarly, Norway and Finland, which were influenced by neighboring countries, decided to switch their driving sides as well.\n\nLooking into more recent changes, some countries like China started manufacturing cars with steering wheels on the left but later shifted production to right-hand drive vehicles, although I'm not entirely sure about the exact timing or circumstances of their change.\n\nWait, actually, I think it's important to verify each country. For instance, China primarily drives on the right side now, but did they switch from driving on the left? Or was that always the case? I might be confusing this with other countries.\n\nAnother example could be Portugal, which historically drove on the left but later changed. However, I'm not certain about the specifics of their switch. \n\nAlso, some former colonies like Mozambique and Angola, which were influenced by Portuguese rule (which used to drive on the left), later switched to driving on the right after gaining independence.\n\nI should also consider countries that were occupied or annexed, as these events sometimes prompt changes in traffic rules. For example, during World War II, some occupied countries might have been forced to change their driving sides by occupying forces, but I'm not sure which specific countries fit this scenario.\n\nSo, compiling all the confirmed examples, the list includes Sweden (1967), Iceland (1968), Norway, Finland, Mozambique, Angola, and possibly Portugal. \n\nWait, does Portugal actually drive on the right now? Yes, they do, so that's a valid example. Also, I recall that some Caribbean nations like Jamaica switched from driving on the left to the right after gaining independence from Britain.\n\nSo adding Jamaica and other similar islands might be appropriate. However, I'm not entirely certain about each country's specific circumstances without further research.\n\nIn summary, the countries that changed their driving side from left to right include Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Finland, Mozambique, Angola, Portugal, Jamaica, and others.

I remember that some countries have more than one capital city for various reasons, like administrative or historical purposes.\n\nFirst off, I know South Africa has three capitals: Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein. That’s a clear example. Then there's Benin, which I think also has two capitals, though I'm not 100% sure. Wait, is it Porto-Novo and Cotonou? Or maybe that's another country. Let me double-check in my mind.\n\nI recall that Bolivia has Sucre as the constitutional capital and La Paz as the administrative capital. So that's two capitals for Bolivia. What about other countries? I think some countries might have multiple capitals due to geographical reasons or political decisions, but I'm not sure of all of them.\n\nWait, the Netherlands comes to mind. They have Amsterdam as the official capital, but the government is in The Hague. So does that count as two capitals? I'm a bit confused there. Also, I think some countries might have interim capitals because of conflicts or other situations, like South Sudan having Juba and another city.\n\nBut I don't want to include incorrect information.

Another key event was the breakup of Yugoslavia, which started in the early '90s and resulted in multiple independent countries.\n\nI should consider if there were any other countries outside of Europe that dissolved during this period.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll think about famous Senegalese football players who are known for their skills in the midfield position. One name that comes to mind is Patrick Vieira, but wait, he was born in Dakar, Senegal, right? But then he moved to France at a young age and played for the French national team. So yes, Patrick Vieira would fit here because he's a midfielder from Senegal who played for France.\n\nNext, I remember there's another player named Alassane Pléa. He was born in Lille, France, but his parents are from Senegal. However, since the question specifies being born in Senegal, I'm not sure if he qualifies because he was actually born in France. So maybe he doesn't count.\n\nThen there's Younousse Sankharé. He was born in Sarcelles, France, to Senegalese parents. Again, similar to Pléa, he wasn't born in Senegal but has Senegalese heritage. The question specifically asks for players born in Senegal, so I think these two might not be included.\n\nI also recall a player named Mame Biram Diouf, who was born in Kédougou, Senegal, and plays as a striker or attacking midfielder. He has played for clubs like Manchester United but did he play for France? No, he actually represents Senegal internationally. So he doesn't fit because he hasn't played for France.\n\nAnother name is Cheikhou Kouyaté, born in Mbour, Senegal. He's a midfielder who plays for the Senegal national team and has had stints at clubs like West Ham United. But again, did he play for France? I don't think so; he represents Senegal internationally.\n\nSo, going back to Patrick Vieira, he seems to be the primary figure here. Are there others? Maybe some lesser-known players who were born in Senegal and played for French clubs or the national team. Perhaps someone like Lamine Gueye or Issa Ba? I'm not as familiar with their careers, but if they fit the criteria, they should be included.\n\nWait, another thought: what about players who have dual citizenship and chose to play for France despite being born elsewhere? But since the question specifies being born in Senegal, even if they later gained French nationality, they would still qualify. So Patrick Vieira definitely fits because he was born in Senegal but played for France.\n\nI think that's about it for now.

It's caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has led to numerous deaths worldwide, including some prominent individuals.\n\nHeads of state include presidents, prime ministers, monarchs, and other leaders of countries. I need to think about which ones might have died from COVID-19 complications.\n\nOne name that comes to mind is John Magufuli, the former President of Tanzania. He was known for his skepticism towards COVID-19 vaccines and measures, and he passed away in March 2021. Although the official cause of death was reported as heart complications, there were speculations that it might have been related to COVID-19.\n\nAnother leader I recall is Joko Widodo, the President of Indonesia. Wait, no, I think he tested positive for COVID-19 but survived. So he's not in the list of those who died.\n\nI also remember that some monarchs passed away during the pandemic. For example, King Goodwill Zwelithini of the Zulu Kingdom in South Africa died in March 2021 after being hospitalized for diabetes complications, and there were reports suggesting he had COVID-19 symptoms. However, I'm not entirely sure if COVID-19 was the direct cause.\n\nThen there's Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who passed away in April 2021. While his death was due to old age, it's possible that underlying health issues related to COVID-19 might have played a role, but again, this is speculative.\n\nI'm trying to think if any other heads of state died directly from COVID-19. There was some news about leaders contracting the virus, like Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who did get seriously ill with COVID-19 but recovered.\n\nWait, there's also the case of President Idriss Déby of Chad, who died in April 2021 under unclear circumstances. Some sources suggested he might have had COVID-19 complications, but this is not confirmed.\n\nI'm struggling to find more concrete examples.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out the logical relationship between the answer sets of two questions about horror movies directed by siblings and twin siblings respectively. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand what each question is asking. \n\nq1 asks for horror movies directed by siblings. Siblings are brothers or sisters who share the same parents. So, any pair of siblings, not necessarily twins, who have co-directed a horror movie would fall under q1.\n\nq2 narrows it down further by specifying twin siblings. Twins are siblings born at the same time, so they're a subset of siblings. Therefore, any horror movies directed by twin siblings would be included in both q1 and q2 because being twins makes them siblings as well.\n\nNow, thinking about the possible relationships between these two sets:\n\n- **Equivalence**: This would mean that every movie in q1 is also in q2 and vice versa. But since not all sibling directors are twins, there could be movies directed by non-twin siblings that wouldn't be in q2. So equivalence doesn't hold.\n\n- **Contains (q1 ⊃ q2)**: This means all answers to q2 are also in q1, but q1 has more. Since twin siblings are a subset of siblings, any movie directed by twins would also be directed by siblings. Therefore, every answer to q2 is indeed an answer to q1. Additionally, there might be movies directed by non-twin siblings that aren't in q2, so q1 includes more answers than q2.\n\n- **ContainedBy (q1 ⊂ q2)**: This would mean all answers of q1 are also in q2, but since not all sibling directors are twins, this isn't the case. So ContainedBy doesn't fit.\n\n- **Overlap**: This is when both sets share some answers but neither contains the other fully. However, in this case, every answer in q2 is in q1, so it's more than just an overlap; it's a complete containment of q2 within q1.\n\n- **Disjoint**: There's no overlap here since twin siblings are still siblings, so their directed movies would be common to both sets. Thus, disjoint isn't applicable.\n\n- **Unknown**: We can confidently determine the relationship based on the definitions provided, so Unknown isn't necessary.\n\nPutting it all together, the most appropriate relation is that q1 contains q2 because every horror movie directed by twin siblings (q2) is also directed by siblings (q1), and there are additional movies in q1 not found in q2.\n</think>\n\nContains"

Hmm, I'm not very familiar with films shot there, but let me think about what I know.\n\nFirst, Yemen is a country in the Middle East known for its unique landscapes and historical sites. I wonder if any big Hollywood movies have been filmed there. Maybe some documentaries? I recall that sometimes documentaries cover regions like Yemen because of their cultural or political significance.\n\nWait, could it be that \"The Square\" was filmed there? No, I think that's about Egypt. How about \"Timbuktu\"? That's set in Mali, so probably not. I'm trying to remember if any major films have used Yemen as a filming location.\n\nPerhaps some independent films or local productions might have been shot in Yemen, but I don't have specific titles coming to mind. It seems like it might be a bit of a challenge because Yemen isn't as commonly featured in international cinema compared to other countries.\n\nI'm also considering if any parts of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" were filmed there, given the regional setting, but I think most of that was shot in Jordan and Morocco. Maybe some scenes from \"The English Patient\"? No, that's mostly North Africa too.\n\nSo, after thinking about it, I realize that I don't actually know specific movies filmed in Yemen. It might be that there are very few or none that are widely known internationally.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't have the information to provide a list of movies filmed in Yemen.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which polygonal numbers less than 100 are also pronic. Let me start by understanding what each term means because I'm not entirely sure about the definitions.\n\nFirst off, a **polygonal number** is a number that can be represented as dots to form a regular polygon. There are different types like triangular, square, pentagonal, and so on. Each type has its own formula to calculate the nth number in the sequence.\n\nNext, a **pronic number**, also known as an oblong number, is a product of two consecutive integers. So it's any number that can be expressed as n(n+1), where n is an integer.\n\nMy task is to find numbers less than 100 that are both polygonal and pronic. That means I need to check various polygonal sequences and see if any of their terms under 100 fit the pronic formula.\n\nLet me start with the simplest polygonal number: triangular numbers. The nth triangular number is given by T_n = n(n+1)/2. Wait a minute, that looks similar to the pronic number formula! In fact, if I multiply both sides by 2, I get 2*T_n = n(n+1), which means every triangular number times 2 gives a pronic number. But does that mean triangular numbers themselves can be pronic?\n\nLet me check with actual numbers:\n\n- T_3 = 6 (since 3*4/2=6). Is 6 a pronic number? Yes, because 2*3=6.\n- T_4 = 10 (4*5/2=10). Is 10 pronic? 2*5=10. Wait, that's not correct. Actually, 10 is between 3*4=12 and 2*3=6. So no, 10 isn't a pronic number.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me list out the triangular numbers up to less than 100:\n\nT_1 = 1\nT_2 = 3\nT_3 = 6\nT_4 = 10\nT_5 = 15\nT_6 = 21\nT_7 = 28\nT_8 = 36\nT_9 = 45\nT_10=55\nT_11=66\nT_12=78\nT_13=91\n\nNow, let's check which of these are pronic. Pronic numbers under 100 are:\n\nn(n+1): 2 (1×2), 6 (2×3), 12 (3×4), 20 (4×5), 30, 42, 56, 72, 90.\n\nComparing both lists, the common numbers less than 100 are 6 and 12. So that's two numbers so far: 6 and 12.\n\nNext, let's check square numbers. Wait, no, I need to stick with polygonal numbers like pentagonal, hexagonal, etc., not just any sequence.\n\nThe nth pentagonal number is given by P_n = n(3n-1)/2. Let me compute a few:\n\nP_1=1\nP_2=5\nP_3=12\nP_4=22\nP_5=35\nP_6=51\nP_7=70\nP_8=92\n\nComparing with pronic numbers, 12 is already on the list. 22 and others don't match.\n\nHexagonal numbers: H_n = n(2n-1).\n\nH_1=1\nH_2=6\nH_3=15\nH_4=28\nH_5=45\nH_6=66\nH_7=91\n\nAgain, 6 is already counted. No new matches.\n\nLet me try heptagonal numbers: H_n = n(5n-3)/2.\n\nH_1=1\nH_2=8 (no)\nH_3=22 (no)\nH_4=40 (no)\nH_5=65 (no)\nH_6=96 (no)\n\nNo matches here.\n\nOctagonal numbers: O_n = n(3n - 2).\n\nO_1=1\nO_2=8 (no)\nO_3=21 (no)\nO_4=40 (no)\nO_5=65 (no)\nO_6=96 (no)\n\nNo matches.\n\nDecagonal numbers: D_n = n(3n - 1).\n\nD_1=2\nD_2=10 (no)\nD_3=24 (no)\nD_4=44 (no)\nD_5=70 (no)\nD_6=102 (>100)\n\nHere, D_1=2 is pronic because 1×2=2. So that's another number: 2.\n\nSo summarizing the findings:\n\n- From triangular numbers: 6 and 12\n- From pentagonal numbers: already included above\n- From hexagonal numbers: already included\n- From decagonal numbers: 2\n\nAre there any others?\n\nLet me check if I missed any polygonal types. Maybe star numbers or centered polygonal numbers.\n\nStar numbers formula is S_n = n(3n - 2).\n\nWait, that's similar to octagonal numbers which we've checked. No matches there.\n\nCentered square numbers: C_n = 1 + n(n+1). Let me see:\n\nC_1=2\nC_2=6\nC_3=12\nC_4=20\nC_5=30\nC_6=42\nC_7=56\nC_8=72\nC_9=90\n\nWait, these are exactly the pronic numbers! Because C_n = 1 + n(n+1) = (n^2 + n + 1), but that's not matching. Wait no, pronic is n(n+1). But looking at centered square numbers, they seem to align with pronic numbers shifted by 1.\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nC_1=2\nC_2=6\nC_3=12\nC_4=20\nC_5=30\nC_6=42\nC_7=56\nC_8=72\nC_9=90\n\nThese are exactly the pronic numbers because n(n+1) +1 = centered square numbers. Wait, no: 2 is C_1 and P_1 (pronic). 6 is both triangular and pronic, but also C_2. Similarly, 12 is pentagonal and pronic, but also C_3.\n\nSo all the pronic numbers under 100 are also centered square numbers. But since we're looking for polygonal numbers that are pronic, and centered square numbers are a type of polygonal number, does that mean every pronic number is also a centered square number? It seems so because both sequences match up to n=9: 2,6,12,20,...90.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies \"polygonal\" which typically refers to standard polygonal numbers like triangular, pentagonal, etc., not necessarily including centered polygonal numbers. So if we include centered square numbers, then all pronic numbers under 100 would also be polygonal (as centered square numbers), but that might be stretching the definition depending on context.\n\nIn most cases, when someone refers to \"polygonal numbers,\" they mean the standard ones like triangular, square, pentagonal, etc., not necessarily the centered versions. So in this case, I think we should stick to the standard polygonal numbers unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, based on standard definitions:\n\n- 2 is a decagonal number and pronic.\n- 6 is triangular and hexagonal, and pronic.\n- 12 is pentagonal and pronic.\n\nThese are the numbers under 100 that fit both categories. I don't think there are others because when checking other polygonal sequences like heptagonal or octagonal, they don't align with any additional pronic numbers beyond these three.\n\nSo, to answer the question: The polygonal numbers less than 100 that are also pronic are 2, 6, and 12.\n</think>\n\nThe polygonal numbers less than 100 that are also pronic are:\n\n$\\boxed{2",

SQLite is also open source, and it's often used in applications because it doesn't require a separate server process.\n\nMariaDB is a fork of MySQL, so it's also open source. Firebird is another option I remember hearing about—it’s an open-source RDBMS that supports various features like stored procedures. H2 is a lightweight Java-based database that's open source, often used in testing environments or small applications.

The Chile national team obviously has Chilean players, but that might be too obvious since they're asking about teams, not just the national squad.\n\nLooking internationally, I know that some South American countries like Argentina and Uruguay have rugby teams with possible Chilean connections, especially if they've played in international competitions or leagues together.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which saints died by crucifixion. Crucifixion is a method of execution that's most famously associated with Jesus Christ, but there are other saints who were martyred this way too. Let me think about some well-known saints and their martyrdoms.\n\nFirst off, Saint Peter, one of Jesus' twelve apostles, is often said to have been crucified upside down in Rome. That's a pretty famous story, so he definitely should be on the list.\n\nThen there's Saint Andrew, another apostle who was also crucified. According to tradition, he asked to be crucified on an X-shaped cross, which is now known as the St. Andrew's Cross. So he should be included too.\n\nI'm trying to remember other saints... There's Saint Philip, one of the twelve apostles, who was martyred by crucifixion in Phrygia. His feast day is in May. Then there's Saint Bartholomew, who was not only crucified but also flayed alive. That's pretty gruesome.\n\nI think there might be some confusion with saints who were martyred in other ways, like beheading or burning at the stake. For example, Saint Paul was beheaded, so he doesn't count here. But I need to focus on those specifically crucified.\n\nWhat about more recent saints? I'm not sure if any modern saints were crucified, since it's a pretty ancient method of execution. Most recent martyrs might have been killed in other ways, like shooting or burning.\n\nSo, compiling the list so far: Saint Peter, Saint Andrew, Saint Philip, and Saint Bartholomew. Are there others? Maybe some less well-known ones. There's also Saint Thomas, who was martyred by being speared, not crucified, so he doesn't fit.\n\nI think that's a good start. Let me check if there are any other notable saints who were crucified. Hmm... I can't recall many others off the top of my head. So the list includes those four: Peter, Andrew, Philip, and Bartholomew.\n</think>\n\nSaint Peter",

Since the previous question compared all saints to just Catholic saints, I realize that some of these saints might be recognized across different denominations.\n\nI'll start by listing any saints I know who have feast days on October 7th. One that comes to mind is Our Lady of the Rosary, but I think her main feast day is in October, though not sure exactly which date. There's also St. Pelagia, but I'm uncertain about her feast day.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to check a reliable source or a saints' calendar for October 7th. However, since I can't access external information, I'll have to rely on my existing knowledge. \n\nI recall that St. Thomas the Apostle is celebrated on July 3rd in some traditions and December 21st in others, so he might not be relevant here. Another thought: St. Pius of Pietrelcina, commonly known as Padre Pio, has his feast day on September 23rd, so that's not it either.\n\nPerhaps there are lesser-known saints or those recognized by specific orders or regions.

Hmm, I'm not very familiar with saints' days off the top of my head, but I'll try to recall or think through it logically. \n\nFirst, I know that different saints are celebrated on various dates throughout the year, often on the anniversary of their death or another significant event in their life. June 15th is one such date, and I believe there might be a few notable saints associated with it.\n\nI remember hearing about Saint Germaine Cousin, who was a French saint known for her piety despite suffering from disabilities and hardships. She lived in the 16th century, and I think her feast day is indeed June 15th. \n\nAnother name that comes to mind is Saint Elisha, although I'm not entirely sure about his feast day. He's an Old Testament prophet, so maybe he's recognized by some Christian traditions on this date.\n\nThere might also be a saint named Saint Augustine of Canterbury, but I think his feast day is actually in late May, so perhaps that's not correct for June 15th. Maybe there's another Augustine? Or perhaps it's a different title altogether.\n\nWait, I'm also recalling something about a martyr called Saint Vitus, whose feast day is around June, possibly the 15th. He was an early Christian martyr, and his story involves being martyred along with his father and another companion. \n\nSo, putting this together, I think there are at least two saints associated with June 15th: Germaine Cousin and Vitus. Elisha is a bit uncertain to me, but considering that he's a biblical figure, it's possible some traditions might commemorate him on this date.\n\nI should make sure not to include any saints whose feast days are on different dates. For example, Saint Anthony of Padua is in June, but I believe his day is the 13th, so he wouldn't be included here. Similarly, other notable saints have their own specific days, so they shouldn't be part of this list.\n\nIn conclusion, based on my recollection and reasoning, the saints with a feast day on June 15th include Germaine Cousin and Vitus, possibly along with Elisha if that's accurate.\n</think>\n\nSaint Germaine Cousin",

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to answer the question, \"Which sauces are named after Italian cities?\" Let's break this down step by step. First, I should think about well-known Italian cities and see if there are any sauces named after them. \n\nStarting with the obvious ones, Bologna is a city in Italy famous for its cuisine. The sauce \"Bolognese\" comes to mind immediately. It's a meat-based pasta sauce that originated in Bologna. That's definitely one.\n\nNext, Milan or Milano is another major Italian city. There's a dish called \"Cotoletta alla Milanese,\" which is a breaded veal cutlet. While this isn't exactly a sauce, there might be sauces associated with it, like a creamy Milanese sauce served with the cutlet. Alternatively, \"Pesto alla Genovese\" comes from Genoa (Genova), so that's another one.\n\nThen there's Naples or Napoli. The famous \"Ragù Napoletano\" is a Neapolitan-style meat ragu, which is a type of pasta sauce. Additionally, the \"Salsa Verde\" isn't specifically tied to a city but is an Italian condiment. However, I'm focusing on sauces named after cities.\n\nFlorence (Firenze) has dishes like \"Pappardelle al Cinghiale,\" which is a wild boar ragu from Tuscany, not directly named after Florence itself. Maybe there's a specific sauce from there, but I can't recall one immediately.\n\nVenice (Venezia) has dishes like \"Fritto Misto,\" but again, not specifically a sauce named after the city. Rome (Roma) is known for \"Amatriciana\" and \"Carbonara,\" which are pasta sauces, but they aren't named after Rome itself.\n\nThinking of other cities, Turin (Torino) has its own cuisine, but I can't think of a sauce specifically named after it. Similarly, cities like Verona or Padua (Padova) might have local dishes, but no prominent sauces named directly after them come to mind.\n\nSo compiling the ones I know: Bolognese from Bologna and Pesto Genovese from Genoa. Also, considering \"Milanese\" as a possible sauce type, even if it's more commonly associated with a cutlet. There might be others that are less well-known or regional, but these are the main ones.\n\nI should also consider whether there are any other sauces I'm missing. For example, \"Salsa Romana\" isn't specifically named after Rome as a city but is an Italian tomato sauce. Similarly, \"Arrabbiata\" is more about the type of sauce than a city name.\n\nSo, to sum up, the primary sauces named after Italian cities are Bolognese (Bologna) and Pesto Genovese (Genoa). There's also the possibility of Milanese being considered if there's a specific sauce by that name.

Let's start with some common ones I know. \n\nFirst, there's marinara sauce—it’s an Italian tomato-based sauce that usually includes onions and garlic. Then there's salsa, which is a Mexican condiment made with ingredients like tomatoes, onions, and garlic. Another one could be teriyaki sauce, but wait, does it always have onion and garlic? I'm not entirely sure about that; maybe sometimes, but not all recipes.\n\nOh, Bolognese sauce definitely has both—it's an Italian meat-based pasta sauce where onions and garlic are sautéed at the beginning. What about stir-fry sauces? Many of them use garlic and sometimes onion, so maybe some varieties fit here. Then there's sofrito, which is a base used in Spanish and Latin American cooking, made by sautéing onions, garlic, and other ingredients.\n\nI should also think about Indian curries—many curry sauces start with frying onions and garlic to build the flavor base. Similarly, Thai red or green curry pastes include garlic and sometimes onions when cooked into a sauce. \n\nWait, I'm not sure if all these examples are accurate. For instance, while some teriyaki recipes might include garlic, it's not a standard component in traditional versions. Similarly, soy sauce itself doesn't have onion or garlic, but certain sauces made with soy might add them.\n\nLet me list the ones I'm more confident about: marinara, salsa, Bolognese, sofrito, Indian curry sauces, and Thai curries.

She was in \"Pulp Fiction,\" but that's more of a crime film, not really sci-fi. Wait, what about \"The Avengers\"? No, that's the Marvel one with Robert Downey Jr., so she's not in that. Maybe I'm confusing it with something else.\n\nOh! There's \"Batman & Robin.\" She played Poison Ivy in that, right? That's definitely a superhero movie, which could be considered sci-fi depending on how you categorize it. But I'm not entirely sure if that counts as pure science fiction or more of an action film.\n\nAnother one might be \"Gattaca,\" but wasn't she in that? Yeah, she played Irene Cassini. That's a sci-fi movie dealing with genetic engineering and all that, so that should definitely count. So \"Gattaca\" is one.\n\nWait, are there others? I think she was also in \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.\" Does that qualify as sci-fi? It has fantastical elements and adventures, but I'm not sure if it's strictly science fiction or more fantasy. Maybe it can be argued either way, so perhaps it's better to include it.\n\nAre there any others? She was in \"Kill Bill,\" but that's more of a martial arts film, not sci-fi. \"Les Misérables\" is historical drama. I'm trying to think if she has done other sci-fi films. Maybe \"V for Vendetta\"? No, that's Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman.\n\nWait, \"The Nymphomaniac\" series? That's more erotic drama, not sci-fi.

Similarly, \"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\" might lean more towards fantasy.\n\nSo maybe \"Gattaca\" is the only clear science fiction film she's been in. Alternatively, if we consider superhero movies as a subset of sci-fi, then \"Batman & Robin\" would also qualify.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which video games are known to be NP-complete and list them out. Let's start by understanding what makes a game NP-complete. A problem is NP-complete if it's both in NP (verifiable in polynomial time) and is at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. For games, this usually means that the game's mechanics involve solving problems that can be reduced to known NP-complete issues.\n\nFirst off, I think about puzzle games because they often involve challenges that could be NP-complete. Games like Tetris or Candy Crush Saga come to mind, but I'm not sure if they're actually classified as NP-complete. Wait, I remember reading somewhere that Tetris is NP-complete when considering the mechanics of fitting pieces together optimally.\n\nAnother game that comes up in discussions about computational complexity is Minesweeper. I believe there was a study showing that certain aspects of Minesweeper are NP-complete, especially determining whether a mine is under a particular square without guessing.\n\nThen there's the classic Snake game. Some research suggests that finding the optimal path for the snake to collect food without hitting itself or walls can be an NP-hard problem, making it potentially NP-complete under certain conditions.\n\nI'm also thinking about adventure games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. While not traditionally seen as a puzzle game, some of its puzzles might involve elements that could be NP-complete, but I'm not sure if that's been formally proven.\n\nWait, there's a game called \"Lemmings\" where you guide creatures through obstacles by assigning tasks. Some levels require complex planning, and I think determining the optimal solution for certain Lemmings levels is NP-hard.\n\nAdditionally, games like Portal involve solving increasingly complex puzzles using a portal gun. The mechanics of finding the right angles and positions could be tied to NP-complete problems, though I'm not entirely certain if it's been formally classified as such.\n\nI should also consider chess. While it's a strategy game, some endgame scenarios or specific chess problems might involve computations that are NP-hard. However, chess itself isn't typically labeled as an NP-complete game, so maybe it doesn't belong on this list.\n\nAnother point is that many games involve pathfinding for non-player characters (NPCs), which can be based on algorithms like A* that deal with graphs. Pathfinding in weighted graphs is related to the shortest path problem, but I'm not sure if that's NP-complete or just computationally intensive.\n\nI also recall that some indie games are designed specifically around NP-complete problems for educational purposes. For example, \"This Is the Only Level\" might have puzzles based on such concepts, but I need to verify this.\n\nLastly, thinking about puzzle platformers like Braid or Antichamber, which involve unique mechanics that could be underpinned by NP-complete logic in their level designs and solutions.\n\nSo, compiling all these thoughts, the games I can confidently list as being known for having NP-complete elements are:\n\nTetris (under certain conditions), Minesweeper (specifically determining mine locations without guessing), Snake (pathfinding for optimal food collection), Lemmings (determining optimal task assignments for level completion), and Portal (solving complex puzzles with portal mechanics).\n\nI think I should double-check if these are indeed recognized as NP-complete or just possess elements that resemble such problems. From what I gather, Minesweeper's problem of determining a mine's location is proven to be NP-complete, Tetris when considering the mechanics of optimal piece placement is also NP-hard, Snake's movement and pathfinding can be modeled as an NP-hard problem, Lemmings' level solutions involve NP-hard task assignments, and Portal's puzzles, especially in more complex community-created levels, can be based on NP-hard logic.\n\nTherefore, these games are examples where their mechanics or certain aspects have been shown to involve NP-complete problems.\n</think>\n\nTetris",

There's the Star Fox series from Nintendo, which definitely features anthropomorphic fox characters as main protagonists. Then there are indie games like \"Ori and the Blind Forest,\" where Ori is a cute, almost fox-like creature. Another one could be \"Fox n Forests,\" which I think has a fox as the main character. Oh, and maybe some platformers or adventure games with foxes as playable characters or companions.\n\nI should also consider if there are any other notable games. Perhaps some RPGs where you can play as a fox or have a fox companion. Maybe in games like \"The Legend of Zelda\" series, though I'm not sure if they specifically feature fox characters.

Let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I should consider both international conflicts and civil wars within South American countries.

Argentina experienced a Dirty War during the 1970s. These are just a few examples.\n\nNext, looking at international conflicts, the Chaco War between Bolivia and Paraguay in the early 20th century comes to mind. There's also the Cenepa War between Ecuador and Peru in the 1990s. Additionally, regional tensions involving countries like Venezuela and Guyana over territorial disputes should be considered.\n\nI must ensure that each conflict listed actually occurred within South America or involved South American countries directly.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out which writers speak French, Arabic, and Japanese. That's an interesting combination of languages because they're from different language families and regions. French is a Romance language spoken primarily in France and parts of Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, and several African countries. Arabic is a Semitic language widely spoken across the Middle East and North Africa. Japanese is a Japonic language spoken mainly in Japan.\n\nFirst, I need to think about writers who are known for their multilingual abilities, especially in these three languages. It's not every day you come across someone fluent in French, Arabic, and Japanese unless they have a specific background or have spent time in regions where these languages are spoken.\n\nI wonder if there are any famous authors or poets who fit this criterion. Maybe someone who was born in one country but grew up in another, or perhaps someone who has traveled extensively and learned multiple languages along the way. For example, someone from Lebanon might speak Arabic and French due to France's historical influence there, and perhaps they also studied Japanese.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a writer from Japan who has a strong interest in Middle Eastern literature could have learned Arabic, and if they were educated in a French-speaking country or have a proficiency in French, that would fit as well. Or perhaps someone from France who has a passion for both Arabic and Japanese cultures, leading them to learn those languages.\n\nI should consider contemporary writers because historical figures might be less likely to have such diverse language skills unless they were diplomats or scholars. However, I can't think of any specific names off the top of my head that are widely recognized as speaking all three languages fluently.\n\nWait, perhaps there are some translators or interpreters who write and are fluent in multiple languages. They might not be famous authors, but their work could involve writing in these languages. Alternatively, maybe there are expatriate writers who have adopted multiple cultures and languages through their life experiences.\n\nI'm also thinking about whether any of the Nobel laureates in literature fit this profile. For example, does anyone like Naguib Mahfouz, who wrote in Arabic but might have known French? He was Egyptian, so he probably knew French as it's commonly taught there, but Japanese is less likely unless he had a specific interest.\n\nAnother angle could be looking for writers involved in international organizations or diplomacy, where knowledge of multiple languages is essential. They might write memoirs or essays that require such language skills.\n\nHowever, without more specific information or examples, it's challenging to pinpoint exact writers who speak all three languages. I might need to do some research or look into literary circles that emphasize multilingualism to find accurate answers.\n\nIn the end, my knowledge on this is limited, so I can't confidently provide a list of such writers.\n</think>\n\nI'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to answer those questions."

Khan Academy is another one; although it's more educational, their YouTube channel likely has over 500k subs and covers math topics.\n\nWait, there's also Math Antics, which I believe focuses specifically on math tutorials.

        "<think>\nOkay, I need to figure out who has won more than one type of Nobel Prize. I remember that some people have achieved this rare distinction. Let's start with Marie Curie; she comes to mind immediately because I think she won two Nobels. She was awarded the Physics Nobel in 1903 and Chemistry in 1911, both for her work on radioactivity.\n\nThen there's Linus Pauling. He won the Chemistry Nobel in 1954 and the Peace Nobel in 1962 for his activism against nuclear testing. That's another person with two different Nobels.\n\nI also recall someone named John Bardeen who worked on transistors and superconductivity. He won Physics Nobels in 1956 and 1972, so that's two Physics prizes.\n\nWait, but the user asked for more than one type of Nobel Prize, not just multiple times. So maybe I should exclude those with multiple awards in the same category unless they also have another category.\n\nI think Al Gore was involved in Peace, but did he win another? Wait, no, he only won the Peace Prize in 2007 for his environmental work. So he doesn't count here.\n\nAnother name that comes up is Malala Yousafzai, but she only won the Peace Prize. So she's not relevant here.\n\nOh, there's someone like Herbert Hoover, but I think he was a U.S. President and might have some humanitarian awards, but I'm not sure if he has multiple Nobels.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The official list shows that as of my last update in July 2024, the individuals who won two Nobel Prizes are:\n\n- Marie Curie (Physics 1903, Chemistry 1911)\n- Linus Pauling (Chemistry 1954, Peace 1962)\n- John Bardeen (Physics 1956, Physics 1972) – but he's in the same category twice\n- Frederick Sanger (Chemistry 1958, Chemistry 1980) – also two in Chemistry\n\nWait, so if we're considering different categories, then Marie Curie and Linus Pauling are the primary examples.\n\nAdditionally, there's someone named Albert Michelson, but I think he only won Physics once. Wait no, that's not correct; he was a Nobel laureate only once.\n\nAnother thought: some organizations have won multiple Peace Prizes, like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which won in 1917, 1944, and 1963.
