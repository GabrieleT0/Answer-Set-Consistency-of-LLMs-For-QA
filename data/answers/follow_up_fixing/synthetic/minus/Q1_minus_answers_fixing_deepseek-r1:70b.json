        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out what notes the open strings on a guitar play under standard tuning. Let me start by recalling what I know about guitars and their tunings.\n\nI remember that a standard guitar has six strings. Each string is tuned to a specific note when played open, which means without pressing any frets. The order of these notes from the thinnest string to the thickest is something like E, B, G, D, A, E. Wait, no, that's not right because the thinnest string is actually the high E.\n\nLet me think again. I've heard that the guitar strings are tuned to E, A, D, G, B, and then another E. So from the lowest pitch to the highest, it's E, A, D, G, B, E. But wait, when you hold the guitar normally, the thinnest string is the high E, so maybe I should list them starting with the high E.\n\nWait no, that might be confusing. Let me visualize the guitar neck. When you look at a guitar, the strings from left to right when played open are usually E (thinnest), B, G, D, A, and then the low E (thickest). But I'm getting confused because sometimes people refer to them as low E and high E.\n\nI think the correct order is: starting from the thickest string at the top (when held in playing position), it's E, A, D, G, B, and then the high E. So when you pluck each open string without pressing any frets, they play E, A, D, G, B, and E again but an octave higher.\n\nWait no, I think that might be reversed. Actually, the standard tuning from lowest to highest pitch is E, A, D, G, B, e (where e is high E). So when you list them in order from the thickest string down, it's E, A, D, G, B, e.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to the strings as 1st to 6th. The 1st string being the thinnest (high E), and the 6th string being the thickest (low E). So in that case, the order from 1st to 6th would be e, B, G, D, A, E.\n\nWait, no, I think it's actually E, A, D, G, B, e when going from 6th string to 1st. Let me double-check this because I don't want to mix up the order.\n\nI've also heard that each open string corresponds to a specific note: the 6th string is low E, then 5th is A, 4th is D, 3rd is G, 2nd is B, and 1st is high E. So when you list them from 6th to 1st, it's E, A, D, G, B, e.\n\nSo the correct sequence of notes for open strings in standard tuning, starting from the lowest pitch (thickest string) to the highest (thinnest), should be: E, A, D, G, B, E. Wait, but that can't be right because the high E is higher than the low E.\n\nWait, no. The correct order is actually E, A, D, G, B, e. So starting from the 6th string (low E), then 5th (A), 4th (D), 3rd (G), 2nd (B), and 1st (high E). Therefore, when listed out in order from 6th to 1st, it's E, A, D, G, B, e.\n\nBut sometimes people list them starting from the first string. So if I were to list them as played from high to low, it would be e, B, G, D, A, E. However, when asking for the notes of open strings in standard tuning without specifying order, it's typically given from lowest to highest, which is E, A, D, G, B, e.\n\nI think I've got that right now: low E, then A, D, G, B, and high E. So the sequence is E, A, D, G, B, E (with the last being an octave higher).\n\nTo make sure, I can recall that each string's note corresponds to the letters EADGBE, which stands for Eddie Ate Dynamite Good Bye Eddie. That helps remember it as E, A, D, G, B, E.\n\nSo putting it all together, the notes are: E (low), A, D, G, B, and E (high). Therefore, when separated by",
        ", it should be E",
        "A",
        "D",
        "G",
        "B",
        "e. But wait, in the response, we need to spell out each note without using abbreviations or acronyms. So instead of 'E', just 'E' since that's already a single letter.\n\nWait no, the instruction says not to use abbreviations but to spell out full terms, so perhaps writing them as individual notes without any letters after. So it would be E",

        "G",
        "B",
        "E, but with high E being another E. Wait, but in standard tuning, the open strings are E (low), A, D, G, B, and e (high). So I think it's better to write them as E, A, D, G, B, E, noting that the last is an octave higher.\n\nBut since the user didn't specify order, maybe listing them in order from low to high. Therefore, the correct sequence is E",

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out in which Olympics the men’s 100-meter sprint world record was broken. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the 100-meter dash is a premier event at the Olympics and World Championships. The world records have been progressing over the years as athletes get faster. I remember hearing about Usain Bolt breaking records, but I'm not sure which specific Olympics that was.\n\nI think Usain Bolt set his first world record before the Beijing Olympics in 2008. Wait, no, he actually broke the record at the 2008 Beijing Olympics with a time of 9.69 seconds. Then, he improved it further at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin to 9.58 seconds.\n\nBut the question is about the Olympics specifically. So, in Beijing 2008, Bolt won gold and set the world record there. He also won in London 2012, but I don't think he broke the world record then; he just defended his title with a time of 9.63 seconds, which was slower than his previous record.\n\nSo, the main instance where the record was broken at the Olympics would be Beijing 2008. But wait, did any other Olympian break the record in another year? I'm trying to recall if there were other instances. For example, Jesse Owens in 1936 or Carl Lewis in 1988. Did they set world records during their respective Olympics?\n\nJesse Owens set multiple records at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, including the 100 meters with a time of 10.3 seconds, which was a world record back then. Similarly, Bob Hayes set a world record at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics with a time of 9.95 seconds.\n\nSo putting this together, there have been multiple Olympics where the men’s 100-meter sprint world record was broken. The ones I can recall are:\n\n1. 1936 Berlin Olympics - Jesse Owens\n2. 1968 Mexico City Olympics - Bob Hayes\n3. 2008 Beijing Olympics - Usain Bolt\n\nI think these are the key instances, but I'm not sure if there were others in between or after that I might have missed. For example, maybe Carl Lewis broke a record in 1988 at Seoul? Let me check that. Oh right, Carl Lewis tied the world record in the 100 meters at the 1988 Seoul Olympics with a time of 9.92 seconds, but since it was a tie, it's sometimes considered as breaking the record depending on the context.\n\nSo adding that to the list:\n\n4. 1988 Seoul Olympics - Carl Lewis\n\nAre there more? Perhaps earlier ones like the 1920s or so. For example, Charlie Paddock set records in the early 20th century, but I'm not sure if he did it at an Olympic event specifically.\n\nAlso, I think Asafa Powell broke the world record before Bolt, but that was at a World Athletics Tour meeting in 2007, not at the Olympics.\n\nSo compiling all these, the Olympics where the men's 100-meter sprint world record was broken include:\n\n- 1936 Berlin\n- 1968 Mexico City\n- 1988 Seoul\n- 2008 Beijing\n\nI don't recall any others off the top of my head. So these four are the ones I can confidently list.\n</think>\n\nThe men’s 100-meter sprint world record was broken in the following Olympics:\n\n1936 Berlin Olympics",

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which countries have both deserts and glaciers. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what defines a desert and what defines a glacier. A desert is typically a dry region with very little rainfall, while a glacier is a large, perennial river of ice formed on land by the accumulation and compaction of snow over time. So, countries that have both would need to have regions with extreme aridity as well as mountainous areas where snow can accumulate enough to form glaciers.\n\nI know that some countries are known for having diverse climates. For example, I'm pretty sure the United States has deserts like the Mojave and Death Valley, and also has glaciers in places like Alaska and Glacier National Park. So the United States of America definitely fits.\n\nCanada comes to mind as well. They have large deserts such as the Great Basin Desert and also have extensive glaciers, especially in regions like the Canadian Rockies and parts of the Arctic.\n\nRussia is another big country with varied climates. I believe they have deserts in areas like the Caspian Depression and certainly have vast ice-covered regions in Siberia where glaciers can be found.\n\nChina has the Gobi Desert, which is a well-known desert region, and also has glaciers in mountain ranges such as the Himalayas and Tian Shan.\n\nArgentina's Patagonia region has both deserts and glaciers. The Patagonian Desert is one of the largest cold deserts, and there are numerous glaciers in the Andes mountains there.\n\nChile shares the same Andes mountain range with Argentina, so they have similar conditions. They have the Atacama Desert, which is very arid, and glaciers in the southern regions.\n\nKyrgyzstan in Central Asia has deserts like the Kyzylkum Desert but also has glaciers in the Tian Shan mountains.\n\nKazakhstan, another Central Asian country, has deserts such as the Aralkum Desert and glaciers in mountainous areas like the Altai range.\n\nIndia's geography includes the Thar Desert and glaciers in the Himalayas. So that definitely fits.\n\nMongolia has the Gobi Desert and some smaller glaciers in its mountain ranges.\n\nPeru is home to the Atacama Desert, which spills into Peru from Chile, and also has numerous glaciers in the Andes.\n\nBolivia has desert regions like the Salar de Uyuni area and glaciers in the Cordillera Real of the Andes.\n\nFrance has deserts such as parts of Corsica or smaller areas, but more notably, they have significant glaciers in the French Alps. Wait, does France actually have deserts? I'm not entirely sure about that. Maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, Spain might be another example, with deserts like Tabernas Desert and some small glaciers in the Pyrenees.\n\nWait, perhaps I can think of more. New Zealand has deserts on the South Island and glaciers in places like the Southern Alps. So New Zealand should be included.\n\nI might have missed some, but so far, I've thought of: United States of America, Canada, Russia, China, Argentina, Chile, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, India, Mongolia, Peru, Bolivia, France (if they actually have deserts), Spain, and New Zealand. Wait, but the user mentioned an exhaustive list. Let me make sure each country indeed has both features.\n\nI need to verify if France has any deserts. The French mainland doesn't really have a true desert, but some regions like Corsica might be considered semi-arid. Maybe it's better to include Spain instead since the Tabernas Desert in Almería is recognized as the only desert in mainland Europe. Spain also has glaciers in the Sierra Nevada and Pyrenees.\n\nSo, adjusting that, I would replace France with Spain. Therefore, the list would be: United States of America",
        "Canada",
        "Russia",
        "China",
        "Argentina",

        "Mongolia",
        "Peru",
        "Bolivia",
        "Spain",
        "New Zealand.\n\nWait, does Peru have deserts? Yes, the Atacama Desert is along its southern coast, and plenty of glaciers in the Andes. Bolivia has the Salar de Uyuni desert area and Andean glaciers. That makes sense.\n\nI think that's a comprehensive list, but I'm not entirely sure if there are more countries with both deserts and glaciers. For example, does Australia have any glaciers? I believe they only have very small ones in the Snowy Mountains, which might be too insignificant to count, and their deserts like the Great Victoria Desert are well-known. But if the glaciers are present, even small, then Australia could fit. Similarly, other countries with mountain ranges may have minor glaciers.\n\nHowever, to keep it accurate, I'll stick to the list I've compiled because those are more definitive examples where both features are clearly present.\n</think>\n\nUnited States of America",

Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about the Spanish Empire and its territories.\n\nI remember that Spain was a major colonial power, especially during the 16th to 18th centuries. They had colonies in various parts of the Americas, including the Caribbean. The first thing that comes to mind is Cuba. Yeah, Cuba was definitely under Spanish rule for a long time before gaining independence.\n\nThen there's Hispaniola, which is the island shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic today. I think the Dominican Republic was once known as Santo Domingo when it was a Spanish colony. So both of these countries were part of the Spanish Empire at some point.\n\nI'm pretty sure Jamaica was also under Spanish control before the British took over in 1655, so that should be included too. Puerto Rico is another one; it's still a territory of the United States now, but historically, it was a Spanish colony.\n\nWhat about the Bahamas? I think they were initially settled by Spain, but later became a British colony. So they should be on the list as well.\n\nWait, what about other islands like Trinidad and Tobago or Barbados? No, I believe those were more under British influence. Maybe I'm confusing them with others. Let me double-check in my mind—Trinidad was Spanish for a time before becoming British, so maybe it's included, but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nOh, also, the Cayman Islands! They were part of the Spanish Empire before they became British. So that's another one to add.\n\nLet me think if there are any others. There's Dominica and Saint Lucia as well, but weren't those more French? Or maybe some Spanish influence... I'm a bit unsure about those. Maybe it's safer to exclude them unless I'm certain.\n\nSo compiling all the ones I'm pretty sure about: Cuba, Hispaniola (which includes Haiti and the Dominican Republic), Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Cayman Islands. Wait, did I miss any?\n\nI think that's a solid list. Let me just make sure each of these was indeed part of the Spanish Empire at some point. Cuba—yes, until 1898. Hispaniola—definitely, as it was the first colony. Jamaica—from 1509 to 1655. Puerto Rico—since 1508 until 1898. Bahamas—early Spanish control before British took over. Trinidad and Tobago—Spanish from the 16th century until ceded to Britain in 1802.

They specified that if I can't answer, I should return \"idk\", and if there's no answer, say 'no answer'. So I need to check if such information is available in my knowledge up until July 2024.\n\nI know that many Nobel laureates are associated with prestigious universities, especially in the United States.

That's been a long-standing issue since partition in 1947. They've had wars over it and still have tensions, so that's definitely one country on the list.\n\nThen there's China. The dispute is mainly about Arunachal Pradesh, which India claims but China also has claims on. There was a major clash recently in 2020 in Ladakh, so that's another key point. I think they also disagree over some other Himalayan territories.\n\nI remember something about Bangladesh as well. They had some issues with border enclaves and maybe river borders? I'm not too sure how active those disputes are now, but I believe there were historical tensions that might still simmer.\n\nNepal comes to mind because of the recent news about a border dispute involving a Himalayan pass or something near Uttarakhand. Nepal published a new map including some areas India claims, so that's ongoing.\n\nBhutan is interesting because India and Bhutan have had issues with China over Doklam, but I think Bhutan itself has border talks with India too. Not as major as the others, but still a point of discussion.\n\nMyanmar, which is Burma, shares a long border with India's Northeast. There might be disputes over the exact boundary lines in remote areas, especially around Nagaland and Manipur. Insurgency and cross-border movements could contribute to tensions.\n\nLastly, Sri Lanka isn't about land borders but maritime boundaries in the Palk Strait.

        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which rivers over 500 kilometers long flow into the Black Sea or the Sea of Azov. First, let's break down what the question is asking for. We're looking specifically at rivers that are longer than 500 km and their mouths are in either the Black Sea or the Sea of Azov.\n\nI remember that the Black Sea is a large body of water located between Eastern Europe and Western Asia. The Sea of Azov is smaller, connected to the Black Sea by the Strait of Kerch. So I need to list all rivers longer than 500 km flowing into these two seas.\n\nLet me think about the major rivers in that region. Starting with the Danube River, which I believe is one of the longest in Europe. It flows through several countries and empties into the Black Sea. The Danube's length is around 2,860 kilometers, so it definitely qualifies.\n\nNext, the Dnieper River comes to mind. It's a significant river in Eastern Europe, flowing through Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine before emptying into the Black Sea. Its length is approximately 2,200 km.\n\nThen there's the Don River, which flows into the Sea of Azov. I think it's around 1,950 km long. Another major one is the Dniester River, which flows into the Black Sea with a length of about 1,360 km.\n\nI also recall the Southern Bug River in Ukraine, which empties into the Black Sea. Its length is around 800 kilometers.\n\nWait, are there any other rivers? Let me think. The Rioni River in Georgia flows into the Black Sea and is about 327 km long. Hmm, that's under 500 km, so it doesn't qualify. Then there's the Kura River, but I think it flows into the Caspian Sea, not the Black Sea.\n\nWhat about the Kuban River? It flows into the Sea of Azov via the Kuban River delta. Its length is approximately 870 km, which meets our criteria.\n\nAre there any others? Let me double-check. The Molochna River in Ukraine flows into the Sea of Azov and is around 197 km long. That's too short. The Orel River is a tributary but not directly into the seas mentioned here.\n\nWait, maybe I missed some. Let me think about Turkey. The Kızılırmak River is the longest river in Turkey that flows into the Black Sea, at about 1,150 km. Then there's the Yeşilırmak and the Çoruh rivers, but their lengths are under 500 km.\n\nIn Russia, the Kuban and Don are already mentioned. Ukraine has the Dnieper, Southern Bug, and Dniester. Romania's Olt River is shorter than 500 km. Bulgaria's rivers like the Kamchiya are also too short.\n\nSo compiling all these, I have Danube (2,860 km), Dnieper (2,200 km), Don (1,950 km), Dniester (1,360 km), Southern Bug (800 km), Kuban (870 km). Also, from Turkey, the Kızılırmak is 1,150 km.\n\nWait, did I get all of them? Let me confirm each river's mouth. Danube into Black Sea, yes. Dnieper into Black Sea. Don into Sea of Azov. Dniester into Black Sea. Southern Bug into Black Sea. Kuban into Sea of Azov.

Each government is led by a Prime Minister and consists of various ministers and deputy ministers from different political parties in the ruling coalition.\n\nThe 67th government would be one specific instance, so I need to identify which parties were part of that particular government. Since the user wants an exhaustive list separated by '",
