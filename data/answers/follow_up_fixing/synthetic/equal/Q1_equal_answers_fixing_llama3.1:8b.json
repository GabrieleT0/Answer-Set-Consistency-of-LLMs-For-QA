However, some studies suggest that they may live up to 215 years.\n\nOstrich - While I couldn't find any specific record of an ostrich living more than 200 years, it's worth noting that some ostriches have been reported to live into their hundreds.

Another country with a Buddhist majority is Sri Lanka, where approximately 70% of the population follows Theravada Buddhism. In addition to these two countries, I can also provide information on other nations with significant Buddhist populations. \n\nCambodia has a large percentage of people who practice Theravada Buddhism, and it's estimated that around 90% of the country's citizens follow this tradition. Also, in Myanmar, roughly 80% of the population practices Theravada Buddhism.\n\nIn terms of countries where Buddhism is not as widespread but still holds significant influence, there are several examples. For instance, in Thailand, about 95% of people practice Theravada Buddhism, even though it's not necessarily a majority religion in the classical sense. \n\nLaos is another country with a Buddhist population; approximately 67% follow Theravada Buddhism, while the rest primarily practice animist or shamanic traditions.\n\nIn addition to these examples, there are several countries with smaller but still significant numbers of Buddhists who belong to various schools and traditions."

These four instrument types are usually organized into three groups: first violins, second violins, violas, and cellos with or without double basses.\n\nIn a standard symphony orchestra, there is usually one group of first violins, which typically consists of 12 to 20 musicians, and one group of second violins, which usually has around 10 to 18 musicians. The viola section often numbers between 8 and 15 players. The cello section may have anywhere from 6 to 12 musicians, depending on the specific composition or arrangement. Double basses are typically fewer in number, usually ranging from 4 to 8 players.\n\nThese exact instrument numbers can vary greatly depending on the specific musical piece being performed and the size of the orchestra.

However, it was Marie Curie who is often attributed with the primary discovery, as she was the one to identify the new element after analyzing pitchblende from uranium mines in Central Europe.\n\nAdditionally, there are some sources that suggest Gustave Bémont made a significant contribution to the discovery of Radium by verifying and confirming Pierre's findings.\n\nHowever, I must correct you - Pierre Curie passed away in 1906 due to injuries sustained in an accident. Marie Curie was awarded two Nobel Prizes for her work on Radioactive elements.\n\nRadium-228 is actually a very rare isotope of Radium that was first synthesized by the American chemist Glenn T. Seaborg and his team at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1951 using the electromagnetic separation of elements from nuclear reactions."

In the United States of America, for example, you can find the Mojave Desert in California, which is one of the hottest places on Earth during the summer months, with temperatures often reaching 49 degrees Celsius. However, the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California also has numerous glaciers, including the Palisade Glacier and the Merced Glacier.\n\nIn Canada, you can find both deserts and glaciers in the province of Alberta. The Red Rock Canyon desert is a unique example of a cold desert that can experience temperatures as low as -40 degrees Celsius in winter, while the Columbia Icefield in Jasper National Park has several glaciers, including the Athabasca Glacier and the Dome Glacier.\n\nIn Greenland, the ice sheet covers about 97% of the island, but there are some areas with desert-like conditions. The Scoresby Sund fjord on the east coast of Greenland is a glacial fjord surrounded by rocky cliffs and sand dunes that resemble deserts in some parts.\n\nFinally, Iceland has several glaciers, including Vatnajökull, which is the largest glacier in Europe, covering over 8,100 square kilometers. However, the country also has areas with desert-like conditions, such as the Reykjanes Peninsula, where volcanic rock and sand dunes create a unique landscape that can be found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nHere's an exhaustive list of countries with both deserts and glaciers:\nAlgeria",
