        "<ctrl94>thought\nThinking Process:\n\n1.  **Identify the user's core request:** The user wants a list of all movies that have won the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\n2.  **Analyze the constraints and formatting rules:**\n    *   **Friendly conversation:** The AI persona is \"talkative and provides lots of specific details from its context.\" However, the final output format is very strict, so I need to reconcile these. The prompt says \"The following is a friendly conversation... AI: [my response]\". This implies the *entire* interaction is the conversation, and my response is just one turn. The user's prompt is very specific about the output format, overriding the general \"talkative\" persona for this specific turn. The user says \"Return me an exhaustive list separated by the symbol '",
        "' don't add any other text.\" This is a direct command for the output format. I must follow this strictly.\n    *   **\"If you cannot answer, return 'idk'\":** I *can* answer this. I have access to this information. So, I will not return \"idk\".\n    *   **\"If the question has no answer, return 'no answer'\":** The question has an answer (a long list of movies). So, I will not return 'no answer'.\n    *   **\"Do not use abbreviations or acronyms, but spell out the full terms\":** This is a key rule. I need to be careful. For example, if a movie title had \"USA\" in it, I'd need to write \"United States of America\". I should scan the list of Best Picture winners for any potential abbreviations or acronyms. A quick mental check of famous winners (e.g., *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, *Forrest Gump*, *The Godfather*, *Casablanca*) doesn't immediately bring up any common acronyms that need expansion. I should be mindful of this, but it's unlikely to be a major issue for this specific list. The term \"Oscar\" itself is a nickname for the \"Academy Award\". The user used \"Oscar\", but the formal name is \"Academy Award for Best Picture\". The user's prompt is \"List the movies that received the Oscar for Best Picture.\" It doesn't ask me to redefine \"Oscar\". It just says \"do not use abbreviations or acronyms\". \"Oscar\" is a proper name/nickname, not an acronym. I'll stick to the movie titles as they are.\n    *   **\"If the response contains numbers or digits, use Arabic numerals\":** For example, \"Star Wars 5\" instead of \"Star Wars V\" or \"Star Wars five\". I need to check the list for any titles with Roman numerals or numbers written as words. A few come to mind: *The Godfather Part II* should be *The Godfather Part 2*. *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* doesn't have a number. *Henry V* would need to be *Henry 5*. Let me check the list of winners. *Henry V* (1944) was nominated but didn't win. The 1989 version was also nominated but didn't win. So that's not an issue. *The Godfather Part II* is a winner. So it must be \"The Godfather Part 2\". I need to be careful with this rule.\n    *   **\"Return me an exhaustive list separated by the symbol '",
        "' don't add any other text\":** This is the most important formatting rule. The output must be `Movie 1",
        "Movie 2",
        "Movie 3",
        "...",
        "Movie N`. No intro, no outro, no \"Here is the list:\", no final period. Just the list.\n\n3.  **Gather the data:** I need to access my internal knowledge base for the complete list of Academy Award for Best Picture winners, from the first one to the most recent one.\n\n    *   1st Academy Awards (for 1927/1928): *Wings*. Also, *Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans* won a unique award for \"Unique and Artistic Picture\", sometimes considered a co-winner of the top prize for that year only. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' official records list *Wings* as the sole Best Picture winner. I should stick to the official list.\n    *   2nd (1928/1929): *The Broadway Melody*\n    *   ...and so on, up to the most recent ceremony.\n    *   96th Academy Awards (for 2023): *Oppenheimer*.\n\n4.  **Process the data according to the rules:**\n\n    *   **List generation:** I will generate the full list of movie titles.\n    *   **Number conversion:** I'll scan the list for Roman numerals. The main one is *The Godfather Part II*. This must be converted to *The Godfather Part 2*. Are there any others? Let me do a quick mental scan or a search. No, that seems to be the only one in the Best Picture winners list.\n    *   **Acronyms/Abbreviations:** I'll scan the list for acronyms. I don't see any common ones like \"U.S.A.\" or \"F.B.I.\" in the titles of the winning films. The titles should be kept as they are. For example, *Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb* was nominated but didn't win. If it had, \"Dr.\" would be a potential point of confusion. The rule says \"spell out the full terms\". Is \"Dr.\" an abbreviation? Yes. But it's part of the official title. Changing it would alter the title. The user's intent is likely to avoid things like \"USA\" -> \"United States of America\". Altering a proper title like *Dr. Strangelove* to *Doctor Strangelove* might be incorrect. However, none of the *winning* films seem to have this issue. Let's stick to the official titles, applying the number rule where necessary.\n    *   **Separator:** I will join all the processed titles with a `",
        "` symbol.\n    *   **No extra text:** The final output will start with the first movie and end with the last movie, with nothing else.\n\n5.  **Construct the final response:**\n\n    *   Start with *Wings*.\n    *   Add `",
        "`.\n    *   Add *The Broadway Melody*.\n    *   Add `",
        "`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Add *The Godfather*.\n    *   Add `",
        "`.\n    *   Add *The Godfather Part 2*. (Applying the number rule).\n    *   Add `",
        "`.\n    *   ...\n    *   Add *Everything Everywhere All at Once*.\n    *   Add `",
        "`.\n    *   Add *Oppenheimer*.\n\n6.  **Final Review:**\n    *   Is it an exhaustive list? Yes, from the first to the most recent winner.\n    *   Is it separated by `",
        "`? Yes.\n    *   Is there any other text? No.\n    *   Are abbreviations spelled out? The movie titles themselves are proper nouns and don't contain abbreviations that need expansion (like USA, FBI, etc.). I'm keeping the titles as they are officially known.\n    *   Are numbers Arabic? Yes, *The Godfather Part II* is changed to *The Godfather Part 2*.\n    *   Does it return \"idk\" or \"no answer\"? No, because I can answer.\n\nThe plan is solid. I will now generate the list based on this plan.<ctrl95>Wings",

The user said \"if the answer contains Star Wars V, indicate it with Star Wars 5\". This implies converting Roman numerals to Arabic. \"18th\" is not a Roman numeral, it's an ordinal number. The instruction is a bit ambiguous here, but \"18\" is an Arabic numeral, so it should be fine. Let's stick to the literal interpretation: use Arabic numerals, don't use Roman numerals. \"18th\" uses the Arabic numeral \"18\". \"Padua's fourteenth-century fresco cycles\" should be \"Padua's 14th-century fresco cycles\". \"Ivrea, industrial city of the 20th century\" should be \"Ivrea, industrial city of the 20th century\". \"Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th Centuries\" should be \"Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th Centuries\".

        "' as a separator.\n8.  **No extra text:** The response should only contain the list separated by the specified symbol.\n\nLet's break down the request. The user is asking for a list of French regions. This is a factual question that I, as a large language model, should be able to answer. My knowledge base includes geographical information.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the current administrative regions of France. There was a major reform in 2016 which merged several regions. I need to provide the list of regions as they exist *now*.\n\nThe regions of France are divided into two categories:\n*   **Metropolitan France:** The part of France in Europe.\n*   **Overseas France:** Territories outside of Europe.\n\nThe user asks for \"all French regions\". This implies I should include both metropolitan and overseas regions.\n\nLet's list the metropolitan regions first (since the 2016 reform):\n1.  Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes\n2.  Bourgogne-Franche-Comté\n3.  Bretagne (Brittany)\n4.  Centre-Val de Loire\n5.  Corse (Corsica)\n6.  Grand Est\n7.  Hauts-de-France\n8.  Île-de-France\n9.  Normandie (Normandy)\n10. Nouvelle-Aquitaine\n11. Occitanie\n12. Pays de la Loire\n13. Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur\n\nNow, let's list the overseas regions (Régions d'outre-mer):\n1.  Guadeloupe\n2.  Martinique\n3.  Guyane (French Guiana)\n4.  La Réunion\n5.  Mayotte\n\nSo, the total numb"
