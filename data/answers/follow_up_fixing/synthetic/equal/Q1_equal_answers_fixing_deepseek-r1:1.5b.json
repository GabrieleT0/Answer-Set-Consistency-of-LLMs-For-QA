        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what political parties in Italy had at least one minister or deputy minister during the 67th Italian Government, excluding independents. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand when the 67th Italian Government was. That would be from January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2025. So any changes or new parties in that span are relevant.\n\nNext, since we're excluding independents, only parties that had some form of official position as minister or deputy minister during that period matter. I remember Italy has been a bit more unified than before with the split of the共和国 into the Umbria region and the rest, but I think the most recent change was in 2014 when the Umbrian region joined Italy, making it a different political party.\n\nI need to list all the major parties that had ministers or deputies. Let me think about Italian politics. The main parties are:\n\n1. **Liberal Party (Consorzi delle Noi Conventtas)** - They were prominent in the early 20th century and still have some influence. They have long-term members, so it's likely they did have ministers.\n\n2. **Right Leader Party (Libreri) -** I believe this is the current major party in Italy. They are known for their progressive policies, so having ministers makes sense.\n\n3. **Conservative Party (Paesi Verosisa)** - This was the ruling party before the split of the共和国. Their long history likely means they had long-term members, including ministers.\n\n4. **Libre-conservative Party (Libres Consécutifs)** - Known for moderate conservative policies, they probably had some ministers or deputies over time.\n\n5. **Bicameralist Party (Lunghelembi) -** They've been a key player in Italy's legislative processes and likely had some influential positions.\n\n6. **Centro-right Party (Istituto Centrale di Ricerca Matematica e Fisica)** - As part of the Umbrian region, they might have had longer-term roles as ministers or deputies.\n\n7. **Polity B (Parti Etnicolari Di La Boeuf)** - This was another regional party that could have had some long-term positions in government.\n\n8. **Consolazzi Di La Marchia Emilia Romagna (Emilia Romagna Consolators)** - As part of Emilia, they likely held government positions over time.\n\nI think these are the main parties that have maintained or had minister positions in Italy's recent history. It's possible there were others before 2014, but since we're excluding independents, we focus on parties with active offices. I should double-check if any of these parties actually had ministerial roles during this period to ensure accuracy.\n</think>\n\nThe political parties in Italy that had at least one minister or deputy minister during the 67th Italian Government (excluding independents) include:\n\n- **Liberal Party (Consorzi delle Noi Conventtas)**\n- **Libreri - Right Leader Party**\n- **Paesi Verosisa (Consarzi Centrale di Istruzione e Cultura)** \n- **Libres Consécutifs (Libre Cesaro Scolastici)**\n- **Lunghelembi (Bicameralist Party)**\n- **Istituto Centrale di Ricerca Matematica e Fisica (Centro-right Party)**\n- **Parti Etnicolari Di La Boeuf (Polity B)**\n- **Consolazzi Di La Marchia Emilia Romagna**\n\nThese parties are part of the most recent political landscape, considering the split in 2014."
