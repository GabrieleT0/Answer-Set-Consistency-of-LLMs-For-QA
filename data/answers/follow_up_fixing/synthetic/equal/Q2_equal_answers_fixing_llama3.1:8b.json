He died that same day due to his injuries.\n\nWilliam McKinley was assassinated on September 6, 1901, while attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. He died eight days later, on September 14, 1901.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt survived an assassination attempt on October 14, 1912, but he was not killed.\n\nJames A. Garfield's shooting and subsequent death occurred sixty-seven days after his inauguration, whereas William McKinley died thirteen days after his injury, indicating a difference in the timing of their deaths.\n\nTherefore, the exhaustive list of sitting American Presidents who were assassinated while in office is:\n\nAbraham Lincoln",
