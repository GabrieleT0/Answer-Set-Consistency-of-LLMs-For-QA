        "John F Kennedy's sister Kathleen was married to William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington, but after his death she married Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam's cousin, the German aristocrat Peter Wentworth-Fitzwilliam was not her husband but rather Thomas Touchet-Jesson, 23rd Baron Audley, was married to a German woman and so was the British politician Oswald Mosley, however, I found that one of the politicians who were married to a German person is Prince Michael of Kent's son Lord Frederick Windsor whose wife Sophie Winkleman has some german ancestry but not exactly what you asked for. \nHowever I also found  John Profumo was married to Valerie Hobson but after her death he married a German aristocrat, Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza also known as Fiona Thyssen."
