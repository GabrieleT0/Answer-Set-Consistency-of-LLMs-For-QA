However, Maurice Barrès was friends with the German writer and philosopher, Houston Stewart Chamberlain's wife, Eva Wagner, who had connections with high-ranking politicians. On the other hand, there is a more recent example: Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the former leader of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany, has been friends with French President Emmanuel Macron and she is married to Helmut Karrenbauer but I could not find any information that links her husband with French politics."
