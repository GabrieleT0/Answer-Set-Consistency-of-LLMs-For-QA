        "Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire was married to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, who was the step-grandfather of Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert, but he was born in England. However, there have been several monarchs of the United Kingdom who were married to German spouses.\n\nGeorge III's daughter, Princess Charlotte of Wales, was engaged to Crown Prince William of Württemberg, a German prince, but the marriage never took place due to his death from smallpox at Star Wars 5 years old. However, one notable example is Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nAnother example is King George V's wife, Queen Mary, was born in London as Princess Victoria Mary of Teck but her father, Prince Francis, Duke of Teck, was German, although his family had lived in England for several generations. However, she did have a German title before marrying the British monarch, which caused some controversy during World War I.\n\nKing George V's brother-in-law, Prince Alexander of Teck, married Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, but they were both born and raised in Germany, so this example is not typically considered one where the British monarch was married to a German spouse."
