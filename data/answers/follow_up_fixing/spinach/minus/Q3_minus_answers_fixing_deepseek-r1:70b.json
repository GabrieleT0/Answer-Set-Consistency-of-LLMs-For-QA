        "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which politicians were married to a German woman. Let me start by understanding the question clearly. It's about politicians who have spouses from Germany. The response needs to be an exhaustive list separated by '",
        "', without any extra text.\n\nFirst, I should think of well-known political figures and their spouses. Maybe starting with American presidents or notable European leaders could help. For instance, Angela Merkel was the Chancellor of Germany, but she's German herself, so her spouse being German doesn't fit unless we're looking for politicians from other countries.\n\nI remember Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, was born in Germany and later became an American citizen. His second wife was Nancy Maginnes, who I believe is American, not German. So that might not count.\n\nAnother thought: John Kerry, the former U.S. Secretary of State, married Teresa Heinz, who is Portuguese-American, so no luck there either.\n\nWait, maybe looking into British politicians. There's Boris Johnson, but his wife Carrie Symonds isn't German. Maybe someone else from the UK or elsewhere.\n\nI'm trying to recall if any famous Canadian or Australian politicians have German spouses. Tommy Douglas, known for Canadian healthcare, was married to Joan Reid, not German.\n\nPerhaps considering more recent figures: Emmanuel Macron of France is married to Brigitte Macron, who's French, so that doesn't help. Looking into other European leaders might be useful but I'm drawing a blank.\n\nI wonder if any notable politicians from countries outside Europe have German spouses. Maybe in Latin America or elsewhere, but nothing comes to mind immediately.\n\nIt seems like this information isn't readily available in my knowledge base, or there aren't many well-known cases. Therefore, the list might be very short or non-existent based on widely recognized figures.\n</think>\n\nno answer"

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which Spanish football clubs in La Liga have won the Champions League. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the Champions League is the top European competition for clubs, and it was previously known as the European Cup before being rebranded in 1993. So, any club that won either the European Cup or the Champions League counts here.\n\nI'll start by recalling the most successful Spanish clubs. Real Madrid is the most famous one with multiple Champions League titles. Barcelona has also had significant success. Atlético Madrid hasn't won it as many times but I think they did win it a couple of times, although maybe that was in the earlier years when it was the European Cup.\n\nWait, actually, Atlético Madrid has reached the finals several times but only won it once? Or not even that? Let me think. No, wait, I believe Atlético Madrid did win it once, perhaps in 1974 or something like that, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, I think they've actually never won the Champions League or European Cup. They reached finals but didn't win any.\n\nLet me confirm: Real Madrid has a record number of titles—something like 14 wins. Barcelona has won it several times as well, maybe around 5 times. Then there's another Spanish club that might have won it once, which is... Hmm. Maybe Sevilla? Wait no, Sevilla has done well in the Europa League but not the Champions League.\n\nWait a minute, I think I'm mixing things up. The only two Spanish clubs that have actually won the European Cup/Champions League are Real Madrid and Barcelona. Atlético Madrid has been runners-up multiple times but hasn't secured a win yet.\n\nSo, to answer the question: the Spanish La Liga clubs that have won the Champions League are Real Madrid CF and FC Barcelona.\n</think>\n\nReal Madrid CF",

I know he's Austrian, actually, so he wasn't even born in Germany. So scratch him off. Next is Til Schweiger. He was born in Germany, and as far as I remember, he still resides there. Armin Mueller-Stahl, however, I think he moved to the United States, so probably not living in Germany anymore.\n\nNastassja Kinski was born in Germany but has lived in various places like France and the USA, so she might not be in Germany now. Udo Kier is another one; he's been based in the US for a long time, I believe. Hanna Schygulla passed away, so that's irrelevant.\n\nMoritz Bleibtreu is definitely still active in Germany, so he should be on the list. Daniel Brühl was born in Germany but now lives in Spain, I think. Heike Makatsch, she's been living in Switzerland if I recall correctly. Brigitte Helm passed away a while ago, so not applicable.\n\nWerner Herzog is still active and based in Germany, so he stays. Franka Potente moved to the US, so she doesn't count anymore.\n\nSo from the original list, Til Schweiger, Moritz Bleibtreu, and Werner Herzog are the ones born in Germany and currently living there.\n</think>\n\nTil Schweiger",

So their parties were different, meaning they don't qualify for this question.\n\nNext, George H.W. Bush was a Republican, and his son George W. Bush was also a Republican. That fits both criteria: father and son were presidents and from the same party.\n\nAre there any other pairs? I'm trying to recall if there are other father-son presidential duos beyond these two. From what I remember, the Harrisons (William Henry and Benjamin) were both Whigs, but as established earlier, they're grandfather and grandson, so it's not a direct father-son relationship. Therefore, they don't count here.\n\nI think that's all. So the only pair where both presidents were from the same party is the Bushes.\n</think>\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush",

I'm trying to remember if Lucy Davis had a role here. She doesn't ring a bell for this one, so maybe she's not in Hot Fuzz.\n\nLastly, The World's End (2013) is about a group of friends during an alien invasion.

In my previous answer, I listed a bunch of countries where English is an official language, but many of them have multiple official languages. Now, I need to narrow it down to those that solely use English.\n\nStarting with the ones from the first list: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago. These are all in the Caribbean and I believe English is their only official language.\n\nThen there's Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America, which have English as their primary and only federal official language. Ireland has Irish as national but uses English widely; however, since Irish is also an official language, maybe it shouldn't be included here.\n\nLooking at Africa: Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritius (though they have Mauritian Creole), Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Swaziland, Zambia, Zimbabwe. Wait, some of these might have other languages recognized or used regionally, but I'm not sure if any are official.\n\nIn Asia: Singapore uses English along with Malay, Chinese, and Tamil, so it's not the only one. Similarly, India has multiple official languages, so it doesn't qualify. \n\nOceania: Fiji has Fijian and English as official, so it's out. Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Vanuatu, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau – I think many of these have their own languages as well, but some might only have English. For example, Nauru's other language is Nauruan, so it's not the only one.\n\nWait, actually, countries like Tuvalu and Nauru have both English and their local languages as official.

Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, and Cologne all have populations well over a million, so they should be excluded from this list.\n\nLooking at Frankfurt, I believe its population is around 700,000, which fits the criteria. Stuttgart has about 630,000 people. Düsseldorf is another city with a population exceeding 600,000, so that's within the range.

Similarly, cities like Nuremberg and Bonn might be in this range, though I'm not certain about their exact populations.\n\nWait, let me double-check: Nuremberg's population is approximately 510k, so that fits.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out all the spacecraft that have successfully landed on Mars. Let's start by recalling what I know about Mars missions.\n\nFirst off, there are the Soviet Union's Mars landers. Mars 2 and Mars 3 were sent in 1971. Mars 2 was a partial success because it crash-landed but returned data during descent. Mars 3 actually landed but only transmitted for a short time before going dark.\n\nThen, NASA's Viking missions: both Viking 1 and Viking 2 had landers that successfully touched down in 1976. They were really significant because they sent back a lot of data about the Martian surface.\n\nFast forward to the 1990s, there was Mars Pathfinder, which included the Sojourner rover. That landed successfully in 1997 using airbags, a new technique at the time.\n\nIn 2004, NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers both landed successfully. They were originally meant for short missions but ended up lasting much longer, with Spirit operating until 2010 and Opportunity until 2019.\n\nThen there was Phoenix Lander in 2008, which also used airbags to land and confirmed water ice on Mars.\n\nMore recently, the Curiosity Rover, part of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, landed in 2012 using a sky crane. It's still operational as of now.\n\nInSight Lander touched down in 2018 and focused on studying the interior of Mars until it lost contact in 2022.\n\nPerseverance Rover is the latest from NASA, landing in 2020 with a drone helicopter named Ingenuity that made the first powered flight on another planet.\n\nFrom other countries, China's Tianwen-1 mission included a lander and rover called Zhurong, which successfully landed in 2021. The United Arab Emirates doesn't have a lander yet; their Hope Probe is an orbiter. India's Mangalyaan is also an orbiter without a lander.\n\nI should make sure to include all these successful landers but exclude orbiters unless they had a separate lander component that succeeded. Also, I need to avoid including missions where the landing failed or only partially succeeded.\n\nSo compiling this list carefully, ensuring each entry actually made it to the surface successfully.\n</think>\n\nMars 2 Lander",

        "<think>\nAlright, I need to figure out which movies Akira Kurosawa directed that are dramas. From my previous knowledge, he has a diverse filmography, so I should go through each of his films and categorize them.\n\nFirst, \"Seven Samurai\" is an epic samurai film with dramatic elements but it's primarily action-adventure. So maybe not purely drama.\n\n\"Rashomon\" definitely has dramatic themes as it explores truth and justice through different perspectives. That's a drama.\n\n\"Yojimbo\" is more of a western-style action film, so probably not a drama.\n\n\"Sanjuro,\" the sequel to \"Yojimbo,\" also falls into action, so likely not a drama.\n\n\"Dodes'ka-den\" deals with social issues and the lives of slum dwellers, which makes it a drama.\n\n\"Red Beard\" is about a doctor and his trainee in a clinic, focusing on character development and moral dilemmas, so that's a drama.\n\n\"Ikiru\" is a powerful story about a man dealing with bureaucracy and personal purpose after discovering he has cancer. Definitely a drama.\n\n\"The Hidden Fortress\" is an adventure film, so not primarily a drama.\n\n\"Stray Dog\" is a film noir, which typically involves crime dramas, so it fits as a drama.\n\n\"S Sanshiro Sugata\" and its sequel are martial arts films, focusing on action rather than drama.\n\n\"The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail\" is historical but more of an adventure or action film.\n\n\"The Quiet Duel\" deals with syphilis and personal struggles, which makes it a drama.\n\n\"One Wonderful Sunday\" focuses on a couple during post-war hardships, so that's a drama.\n\n\"Drunken Angel\" is about a doctor and a gangster dealing with their own issues in a post-war setting, so drama.\n\n\"The Bad Sleep Well\" tackles corporate corruption, which fits as a drama.\n\n\"Don't You Remember?\" is an early short film; I'm not certain of its genre, but if it's by Kurosawa, likely to have dramatic elements.\n\n\"Kagemusha\" is more of a historical epic with political themes but does involve character drama. However, since the user specifically asked for dramas, and it's more about a decoy's story, I might include it as it has strong dramatic components.\n\nSo compiling all these into an exhaustive list of dramas directed by Kurosawa.\n</think>\n\nRashomon",

From what I remember, the Colorado River is divided into two main basins: the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin. The Upper Basin generally refers to the area where the river originates and flows through higher elevations before it reaches the Lower Basin.\n\nI know that the Colorado River starts in Colorado, so that's definitely part of the Upper Basin. From there, it flows southwest into Utah, where it passes through areas like Lake Powell. After Utah, it goes into Arizona, but I think Arizona is more associated with the Lower Basin because that's where the Grand Canyon and Lake Mead are located.\n\nWait, no, actually, some parts of Arizona might still be in the Upper Basin. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me think again. The Upper Colorado River Basin includes parts of several states. I recall Wyoming being part of it because the river flows through the Rocky Mountains there. New Mexico is another state where the Upper Basin extends, as the river passes through the northwestern part before heading into Arizona.\n\nSo, putting this together: Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and New Mexico are in the Upper Basin.

        "Alright, so I need to figure out which countries have Spanish as an official language and also do NOT have any non-Indo-European official languages. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, from my previous answer, I know that the countries with Spanish as a national or official language are Spain, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nNow, I need to check each of these countries to see if they have any official languages that are not part of the Indo-European family. The Indo-European family includes languages like Spanish, English, French, Portuguese, etc., while non-Indo-European languages would be from other families such as Sino-Tibetan, Niger-Congo, Uralic, etc.\n\nLet's go through each country:\n\n1. Spain: Official language is Spanish (Indo-European). No other official languages. So it qualifies.\n2. Mexico: Spanish is the only official language at the federal level, though there are many indigenous languages recognized. However, since none of these are official at the national level, Mexico still counts.\n3. Guatemala: Spanish is an official language along with twenty-two Mayan languages and two other indigenous languages (all non-Indo-European). So Guatemala does NOT qualify because it has non-Indo-European official languages.\n4. Honduras: Only Spanish is official.\n5. El Salvador: Only Spanish is official.\n6. Nicaragua: Spanish is the main official language, but they also have English as a co-official language in some regions and may recognize indigenous languages like Miskito. However, I'm not sure if any non-Indo-European languages are official at the national level. Let me check: Nicaraguan Sign Language is recognized, which isn't a spoken language family issue. The main other language is English, which is Indo-European. So Nicaragua might still qualify.\n7. Costa Rica: Only Spanish is official.\n8. Panama: Spanish is official; there are indigenous languages recognized but not as national official languages.\n9. Colombia: Spanish is the only official language at the national level. Some indigenous languages have recognition but aren't official nationwide.\n10. Venezuela: Spanish is the sole official language.\n11. Ecuador: Spanish and Kichwa (an indigenous, non-Indo-European language) are both official. So Ecuador does NOT qualify.\n12. Peru: Spanish and Quechua (non-Indo-European) are official. So Peru doesn't qualify.\n13. Bolivia: Spanish along with Quechua and Aymara, which are non-Indo-European. So Bolivia is out.\n14. Chile: Only Spanish is official at the national level. Mapudungun has some recognition but isn't an official language nationwide.\n15. Paraguay: Official languages are Spanish and Guarani (Guarani is a Tupi language, not Indo-European). So Paraguay doesn't qualify.\n16. Uruguay: Only Spanish is official.\n17. Argentina: Only Spanish is official.\n18. Cuba: Only Spanish is official.\n19. Dominican Republic: Only Spanish is official.\n20. Equatorial Guinea: Spanish and French (both Indo-European) are official, along with Portuguese in some contexts. So all their official languages are Indo-European.\n\nWait, I need to verify for Nicaragua again.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which countries share only a land border or only a maritime border with Spain, but not both. Let's start by reviewing the previous answer where Spain shares borders with France, Andorra, Portugal, United Kingdom (Gibraltar), Morocco, Algeria, Italy, and Tunisia.\n\nFirst, let me break down each country:\n\n1. **France**: Shares a land border with Spain across the Pyrenees mountains. Does it also share a maritime border? Well, in the Mediterranean Sea, France has territories like Corsica, which is relatively close to Spanish islands like the Balearics. So I think France and Spain might have both land and maritime borders.\n\n2. **Andorra**: This tiny principality is entirely surrounded by France and Spain, so it only shares a land border with Spain.\n\n3. **Portugal**: Shares a long land border with Spain on the Iberian Peninsula but does not share any maritime borders since they are separated by the Atlantic Ocean without any overlapping maritime boundaries.\n\n4. **United Kingdom (Gibraltar)**: Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory on the Iberian Peninsula, sharing a land border with Spain. Since it's on the Mediterranean coast, does it also have a maritime border? I think so because Gibraltar's coastline would naturally share maritime borders with Spain across the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\n5. **Morocco**: Shares both land and maritime borders. The land border is through the enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and there are extensive maritime borders in the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean due to the Canary Islands.\n\n6. **Algeria**: Only shares a maritime border with Spain across the Mediterranean Sea. There's no shared land border because Algeria is separated from Spain by Morocco.\n\n7. **Italy**: Shares only a maritime border through the Mediterranean Sea, particularly near the Balearic Islands and Sardinia. No land borders exist between Spain and Italy.\n\n8. **Tunisia**: Shares a maritime border in the central Mediterranean. There's no direct land connection with Spain.\n\nWait, I'm a bit confused about France and Gibraltar. If France shares both land and maritime borders with Spain, then it shouldn't be included in this list since we're only looking for countries that share either one or the other but not both. Similarly, Gibraltar (UK) might share both because of its coastal location.\n\nSo let me re-examine:\n\n- **Andorra**: Only land.\n- **Portugal**: Only land.\n- **Algeria**: Only maritime.\n- **Italy**: Only maritime.\n- **Tunisia**: Only maritime.\n- **Morocco**: Both, so exclude.\n- **France**: Both, so exclude.\n- **Gibraltar (UK)**: Both, so exclude.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Gibraltar only shares a land border because it's on the Iberian Peninsula. Does Gibraltar have its own maritime borders separate from Spain? Since it's surrounded by Spanish territory, perhaps its entire coastline is adjacent to Spain, meaning only a land border. But I'm not entirely sure if Gibraltar has any maritime border that isn't also Spanish.\n\nIf Gibraltar shares both land and maritime borders with Spain, then it should be excluded. If not, maybe it only shares land. This requires more precise information. For the sake of this exercise, I'll assume Gibraltar shares only a land border with Spain, but in reality, it's surrounded by Spanish waters, so perhaps it also has a maritime border.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated. To simplify, let me list countries that definitely share only one type:\n\n- **Andorra**: Only land.\n- **Portugal**: Only land.\n- **Algeria**: Only maritime.\n- **Italy**: Only maritime.\n- **Tunisia**: Only maritime.\n\nFrance and Morocco likely share both, so they're excluded. Gibraltar might share both as well, but if not, it would only share a land border. Since I'm uncertain about Gibraltar's maritime borders, I'll exclude it for now to be safe.\n\nSo the final list includes Andorra, Portugal (only land), Algeria, Italy, and Tunisia (all maritime). Wait, no, that can't be right because Andorra is land-only and others are maritime-only.\n\nWait, let me structure this correctly:\n\nCountries sharing only a land border: Andorra, Portugal.\n\nCountries sharing only a maritime border: Algeria, Italy, Tunisia.\n\nSo the exhaustive list should include both categories but separated into those with only land or only maritime. However, the question is asking for countries that share either land or maritime, not both. So combining them, the list would be:\n\nAndorra",
        "Portugal",
        "Algeria",
        "Italy",
        "Tunisia\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought Gibraltar might only have a land border, so if it's included, then the list would also have Gibraltar (UK). But without certainty, perhaps it's better to exclude it.\n\nTherefore, the exhaustive list is:\n\nAndorra",

Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt is also a comedy. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is a comedy-drama but leans heavily into comedy.

No, they're quite far apart.\n3. **North Carolina**: Similarly, North Carolina is further southeast and doesn't border Illinois.\n4. **Georgia**: In the deep south, so no shared border with Illinois.\n5. **Alabama**: Also in the south, doesn't share a border with Illinois.\n6. **Mississippi**: Again, southern state without a direct connection to Illinois.\n7. **Arkansas**: Southwest of Tennessee; does it touch Illinois?

From my previous thought process, I listed Arthur Tudor, Margaret Tudor, Henry VIII, and Mary Tudor as his main children.\n\nI know that Arthur Tudor married Catherine of Aragon but died shortly after the wedding, probably in his late teens or early twenties. That means he reached adulthood, though his life was cut short.\n\nMargaret Tudor married James IV of Scotland and had children, so she definitely lived into adulthood. Henry VIII is famous for being the next king, obviously an adult. Mary Tudor, who became Queen of France and then Duchess of Suffolk, also lived a full life as an adult.\n\nI think there might have been younger siblings like Edmund or Elizabeth, but they died in childhood. So focusing on the ones that survived to adulthood: Arthur, Margaret, Henry, and Mary.\n</think>\n\nArthur Tudor",

Let's check each:\n\n- **Simone Signoret**: Born in 1921 in France, she won an Oscar for \"Room at the Top\" in 1960.\n- **Marion Cotillard**: She was born in 1975, which is after 1970, so she doesn't qualify.\n- **Juliette Binoche**: Born in 1964, also after 1970.\n- **Jean Dujardin**: Born in 1972, again post-1970.\n\nSo, only Simone Signoret fits the criteria of being born in France before 1970 and having won an Oscar.\n\nI can't think of any other French-born actors from before 1970 who have won Oscars. Maybe someone like Charles Boyer or Maurice Chevalier? But I believe they were nominated but didn't win.

The user wants a comprehensive list, and if I can't answer, I should say \"idk\". If there's no answer, return 'no answer'. Also, I shouldn't use abbreviations; spell everything out fully. Numbers should be in Arabic numerals.\n\nFirst, I recall that the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was established around 1950, but that was in Europe, not the United States. So that's not applicable here.\n\nNext, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was founded in 1950 as a specialized agency of the UN, but it's headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, so not based in the U.S.\n\nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was established in 1949, just before 1950, and its headquarters is in Brussels, Belgium. So that's not relevant for 1950 or the U.S.\n\nI'm trying to think of any international organizations with headquarters in the United States that were founded in 1950. The United Nations (UN) itself was established in 1945 in San Francisco, but that's before 1950.\n\nThe World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) are both based in Washington, D.C., but they were established in 1944 as part of the Bretton Woods system, so that's earlier than 1950.\n\nIs there any other organization? Maybe something related to defense or economics based in the U.S. The Department of Defense was created in 1947 with the National Security Act, but that's a government department, not an international organization.\n\nWait, perhaps some non-governmental organizations (NGOs) or private international organizations were founded in the U.S. in 1950. Let me think... Maybe something related to technology or science.\n\nI know that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) was founded earlier, in 1918. The Internet Society (ISOC) was established much later, in 1992.\n\nWhat about educational institutions? For example, some universities have international ties, but they aren't organizations per se.\n\nWait, perhaps the International Rescue Committee (IRC) was founded in 1950. Let me check: no, IRC was actually founded earlier, in 1933 at the request of Albert Einstein to help refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.\n\nAnother thought: The National Science Foundation (NSF) in the U.S. was established in 1950. Wait, yes! NSF is a government agency that supports scientific research, but it's a national organization rather than an international one.\n\nIs there any other organization? Maybe something related to business or trade. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is older, founded in 1912.\n\nWait, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was established later, in 1960, so that's after 1950.\n\nI think I can't recall any international organizations specifically founded in the United States in 1950.

However, just to be thorough, I'll double-check each president's birth year again to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking at the list of presidents and their birth years:\n\n- Joe Biden: 1942\n- Donald Trump: 1946\n- Barack Obama: 1961\n- George W.

Eisenhower (1890), Harry Truman (1884), Franklin Roosevelt (1882), Herbert Hoover (1874), Calvin Coolidge (1872), none are close to 1945 either.\n\nTherefore, since there are no US presidents born in 1945, the question of them being elected before 2000 is moot. There's simply no one fitting both criteria.\n\nI should also consider if any lesser-known presidents or those who served very briefly might have been born in 1945, but as far as I can recall, all US presidents up to now were either born before or after 1945, not exactly in that year.\n</think>\n\nno answer"

The Bundesliga was founded in 1963, so I should consider all winners since then.\n\nStarting with Bayern Munich, they are the most successful and frequent champions. Borussia Dortmund has also won multiple titles. RB Leipzig hasn't won any yet, as they're relatively new to the top tier and haven't secured a championship. \n\nEintracht Frankfurt has won once before. Union Berlin and SC Freiburg haven't won any Bundesliga titles. TSG Hoffenheim is another club without a title. Bayer Leverkusen, despite being successful in other competitions like the DFB-Pokal, hasn't won the Bundesliga.\n\nFC Augsburg, VfL Wolfsburg has actually won once in 2009. Borussia Monchengladbach was a dominant force in the 70s with multiple titles. Werder Bremen has several championships as well. Schalke 04, despite recent relegations, has had success historically.\n\nVfB Stuttgart and Werder Bremen each have a few titles. FSV Mainz 05 hasn't won any yet. 1. FC Koln was one of the original winners in the early years. Darmstadt 98 and Heidenheim are newly promoted and haven't won any Bundesliga titles.\n\nSo compiling this, the teams from my previous list that have won the Bundesliga before are: Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Borussia Monchengladbach, Werder Bremen, Hamburg SV isn't in the current list but has won before.

Starting from my previous knowledge, Japan has several major islands with large populations.\n\nFirst off, Honshu is definitely the most populous island in Japan, with cities like Tokyo and Osaka. Its population is way over 100,000. Next, Hokkaido is another major island, known for its agriculture and cities like Sapporo. It's also well above that threshold.\n\nThen there's Kyushu, which includes Fukuoka and other big cities. Shikoku, though smaller than Honshu, has a significant population as well. Okinawa is the largest island in the Ryukyu chain but I'm not sure if its population alone exceeds 100,000 or if it's just part of the larger prefecture.\n\nWait, actually, when considering individual islands, some might have lower populations than others. For example, while the Okinawa Prefecture has a sizable population, the main island of Okinawa itself may or may not cross the 100k mark on its own. I think it does because Naha is a major city there.\n\nI'm not sure about the smaller islands like Sado or Awaji. They might have populations under 100,000. Similarly, places like Yakushima and Tanegashima are beautiful but probably don't reach that number. So, focusing on the main four: Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and Okinawa.\n\nI should double-check if Okinawa's population is indeed over 100k. If not, maybe it shouldn't be included.

Binge-Eating Disorder involves recurrent binge eating without those compensatory actions. \n\nI should make sure there are no other recognized disorders beyond these two that fit the criteria. Other disorders like Anorexia Nervosa primarily involve restriction and may not necessarily include binge eating as a core symptom, though some subtypes might.

Nevada is another one, though I think parts near Las Vegas might be in Pacific Time, but the majority is Mountain.

Arizona is tricky because most of it doesn't observe daylight saving time, except for the Navajo Nation, which does follow it. So, only a part of Arizona is in Mountain Time, specifically the Navajo reservation.\n\nThen there are states where only parts are in Mountain Time.

        "<think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out which films Clint Eastwood not only starred in but also directed and produced himself. From my previous answer, I listed several films where he acted and directed. Now, adding producing into the mix requires checking if he was involved in that capacity as well.\n\nStarting with \"Unforgiven\"—I believe he produced it along with directing and starring. That's a strong candidate.\n\n\"High Plains Drifter\" is another one; I think he produced it too. Same goes for \"The Outlaw Josey Wales.\" Both were directed by him, starred him, and likely produced as well.\n\n\"Bronco Billy\" probably had him as producer since he was heavily involved in the project beyond acting and directing.\n\n\"Sudden Impact,\" part of the Dirty Harry series, I'm pretty sure he produced it. He had creative control over that character's films.\n\n\"Pale Rider\"—he might have been a producer there too, considering his involvement in bringing the story to life.\n\n\"Million Dollar Baby\" is another film where he not only acted and directed but also produced it. It won several awards, so his production role makes sense.\n\n\"Gran Torino\" definitely had him as producer; he was quite involved in all aspects of that film.\n\n\"The Bridges of Madison County,\" I'm certain he produced it alongside directing and starring.\n\nI don't recall any other films beyond these where he did all three roles.

They made a lot of comedies together, both short films and features. Titles like \"Sons of the Desert\" (1933) and \"Way Out West\" (1937) come to mind. Then there are their other features like \"The Devil's Brother\" (1933), \"Babes in Toyland\" (1934), and \"A Chump at Oxford\" (1940).\n\nNext, Hal Roach is also known for the Little Rascals series, which includes a bunch of comedy shorts featuring child actors. These were produced from the 1920s to the 1950s, so there are quite a few episodes there.\n\nHe also produced other comedy series, like those starring Patsy Kelly and Thelma Todd. Their comedies were popular in the 1930s. Titles might include \"Thelma Todd and Patsy Kelly in 'Battling Kisses'\" or similar ones from that era.\n\nAdditionally, Hal Roach's studio produced some feature-length comedies beyond just Laurel and Hardy. For example, \"Top Hat\" (1935) with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is a classic comedy under his production.\n\nI should make sure to separate the list by '",

Let me think about famous people from that era.\n\nOne name that comes to mind is Ludwig Boltzmann, an Austrian physicist. He was born in Vienna in 1844 but died in Duino, Italy, so that doesn't fit.\n\nThen there's Sigmund Freud, born in Freiburg (now Příbor, Czech Republic) but raised in Vienna. He died in London, not Berlin.\n\nFranz Schubert was born in Vienna and died there as well, so he's out.\n\nAnother possibility is composers like Johann Strauss II, who was born and died in Vienna.\n\nWait, perhaps someone from the arts or literature? Maybe a writer or poet who moved to Berlin for their career.\n\nI'm trying to recall if any notable philosophers or scientists from Vienna before 1900 ended up in Berlin. Maybe someone like Ernst Mach? He was born in Turas, Moravia (now Czech Republic) and died in Václavice, so no.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps a political figure who moved from Vienna to Berlin. But many politicians of that time were more associated with their birthplaces.\n\nWait, there's Max Planck, but he was born in Kiel, Germany, not Vienna. He did work in Berlin for a while but died in Göttingen.\n\nI can't think of any prominent individuals who fit this criterion.

From my previous knowledge, Yeti Airlines is a regional carrier based in Nepal, focusing mainly on domestic routes with some international flights.\n\nI remember that their main hub is Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, which is the capital and largest city of Nepal. So that's definitely one airport they serve domestically.\n\nAnother key destination for them is Pokhara Airport. Pokhara is a major tourist spot, known for its natural beauty and proximity to the Himalayas, so it makes sense they would have regular flights there.\n\nThen there's Biratnagar Airport, located in the eastern part of Nepal. It serves the Morang district, which is an important area, so Yeti likely operates there as well.\n\nBharatpur Airport comes to mind too; it's near Chitwan National Park, a popular destination for wildlife tours and safaris, so that's another domestic airport they probably serve.\n\nI also recall Bhadrapur Airport in Jhapa district, which is in the eastern part of Nepal. It's an important city, so Yeti Airlines likely includes this in their routes.\n\nLukla Airport is another one I think about; it's a small airstrip famous for being the starting point for Everest treks. The airport is known for its short runway and high altitude, which makes it challenging but necessary for trekking enthusiasts.\n\nWait, did I mention Tribhuvan International Airport already? Yes, that's Kathmandu's main airport. So putting all these together, the domestic airports Yeti serves are Kathmandu (Tribhuvan), Pokhara, Biratnagar, Bharatpur, Bhadrapur, and Lukla.\n\nI don't think there are any other domestic airports they serve beyond these six.

But now, focusing on what came out after he died.\n\nOne book that comes to mind is \"Visions of Gerard\". I believe this was published posthumously, maybe in the early 1970s. It's a novel that deals with his brother Gerard, who died young. \n\nAnother one could be \"Satori in Paris\", which I think came out after his death as well. This book is about his search for his ancestry in France and might have been released in the late 1960s or early 1970s.\n\nI'm not entirely sure about \"Pic\" being posthumous.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should remember what Grunge is—it's a subgenre of alternative rock that started in Seattle in the late 1980s. Bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam are famous from that scene. Now, focusing on Canada, I need to think about record labels there that are involved with Grunge bands.\n\nI know Sub Pop is a big name in Grunge, but it's based in Seattle, not Canada. So that's out. Are there any Canadian indie labels that have been part of the Grunge movement? Maybe some smaller or local ones?\n\nI'm trying to think if any notable Canadian Grunge bands exist. Most of the well-known Grunge bands are from the U.S., especially Seattle. I don't recall many from Canada, which might mean there aren't many Canadian labels specifically tied to Grunge.\n\nHowever, perhaps some current indie labels in Canada support Grunge or similar genres. Let me think about any that come to mind. There's maybe labels like Mint Records or Sudden Death Records, but I'm not sure if they're directly associated with Grunge. They might be more indie rock or punk.\n\nAlso, considering the original instruction, the user wants currently active labels. So even if there were some in the past, unless they're still around, they wouldn't count. But again, without specific knowledge, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven all this, I think there might not be a list of Canadian record labels specifically associated with Grunge music, especially active ones.
