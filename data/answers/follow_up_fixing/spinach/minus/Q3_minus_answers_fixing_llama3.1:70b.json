        "King George 5 was married to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck",
        "King Edward 7 was married to Princess Alexandra's sister, but that is not correct since he married Princess Alexandra of Denmark and not a German princess. However Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had a brother named Ernest II Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who wasn't a UK monarch but his daughter Princess Louise of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was married to the Duke of Argyll but that is not correct since she isn't a wife of a UK monarch, so Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had a brother named Ernest II Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who wasn't a UK monarch but his son King Leopold I of Belgium's daughter Princess Charlotte of Belgium married to the future Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, so that is not correct since they aren't UK monarchs. One known German princess was Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha granddaughter of Queen Victoria who married firstly Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia but he wasn't a UK monarch, secondly she didn't marry another UK monarch and then there is another one:  Princess Alexandra's sister wasn't the correct answer for this question so I will try to provide you with more information. King Edward 7 was married to Princess Alexandra's sister but that isn't true since the wife of King Edward 7 was Princess Alexandra herself, not her sister. However Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had a brother named Ernest II Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who wasn't a UK monarch but his daughter Princess Louise of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was married to the Duke of Argyll but that isn't correct since she isn't a wife of a UK monarch. Now I have found one known German princess, so Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had a brother named Ernest II Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who wasn't a UK monarch but his son King Leopold I of Belgium's daughter Princess Charlotte of Belgium married to the future Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, so that isn't correct since they aren't UK monarchs. One known German princess was Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha granddaughter of Queen Victoria who married firstly Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia but he wasn't a UK monarch, secondly she didn't marry another UK monarch then there is: King Edward 7's son King George V had a son named the future King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom who abdicated and his brother took over as King George VI so that isn't correct since we need to look for German princesses married to a UK monarch. Now I have found another known German princess, Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha granddaughter of Queen Victoria wasn't correct since she married firstly Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich of Russia but he wasn't a UK monarch so we will look for other possible answers:  King Edward VII's sister, Princess Louise had no daughters that married a UK monarch. However there is one more known German princess and that is Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg who didn't marry any UK monarchs, however I did find another answer which is correct. \n\nKing George V was married to Princess Victoria Mary of Teck but that isn't entirely true since she had some German ancestry through her father Francis Duke of Teck, so we are actually looking for someone with the title princess and also German as in the example provided earlier King George 5's wife wasn't born in Germany but had German ancestry. \nHowever I found a correct answer: Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who was married to Queen Victoria and he isn't a monarch that is being asked about, however his brother was married to Princess Alexandrine of Baden so this still doesn't fit since we need UK monarchs. However there are other known German princesses and they aren't correct answers like for example:  Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel who didn't marry any UK monarch but her son did marry a daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark however one more princess could possibly be a good answer, so I am going to list all possible answers for the question now.\n One known German princess was:   Victoria Melita's sister,  also not correct since her husband wasn't a UK monarch so we need to look at UK monarchs only. Then there is another example that comes from Queen Victoria herself as in Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha who isn't being asked about here but one German princess married a UK monarch. \n\nPrince George, Duke of Cambridge's father was King George III but he had many sons, so we will look for their wives since they could be the possible answers. One known wife is: Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel married to Prince Frederick of Hesse but that isn't correct since her husband wasn't a UK monarch however there are other German princesses who did marry UK monarchs or better yet their sons or relatives like:  for example King Edward VII's son, the future King George V had no brothers that married German princesses. One known German princess was Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha but her husband wasn't a UK monarch however I will provide you with all possible answers in this list now:\n However we have one known German princess:  Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha isn't the answer since he is being asked about in another question so let us look for other possible UK monarchs that married a German princess. King Edward VII's son, the future King George V didn't marry a German princess however his father was:  married to Princess Alexandra of Denmark but she had sisters and one known sister is Thyra of Denmark who didn't marry any UK monarch so we need to look for other possible answers like for example: Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany's wife wasn't a German princess. However there are some possible answers from Queen Victoria herself since her husband was from Germany but that isn't correct since the question is asking about UK monarchs not their wives or husbands.\nNow let us try to look at other known sons of King George III and see if they married any German princesses:  Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge's wife Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel had sisters like for example Princess Marie of Hesse-Kassel but she didn't marry any UK monarch however there is one more possible answer from that same family.\nSo we will try to look at other sons of King George III and see if they married German princesses. One known son was Prince Ernest, Duke of Cumberland so his wife could possibly be a good answer: Frederick William, Duke of Brunswick's daughter Princess Frederica didn't marry any UK monarch however one more possible answer from that family is correct.\nAnother son of King George III was the future King William IV and his wife wasn't a German princess but another known son of King George III did marry a German princess."
