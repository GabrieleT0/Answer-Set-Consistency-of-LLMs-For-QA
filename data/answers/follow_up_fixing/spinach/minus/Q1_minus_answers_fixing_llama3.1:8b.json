        "I've retrieved relevant information on politicians married to a German person. Here's my answer:\n\nJacqueline Kennedy Onassis was married to Aristotle Onassis, who was born in Smyrna, Ottoman Empire (now İzmir, Turkey), but later became a naturalized citizen of Greece and had strong connections with Germany through his business dealings. However, her first husband, John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States of America, did not have a known marriage to a German person.\n\nWinston Churchill's wife Clementine was half-French and half-British, but her father was of British descent with no known German ancestry.\n\nBaroness Angela Burdett-Coutts' husband was William Cotton, a businessman with connections to the textile industry in England and Germany. However, I do not have information confirming their marriage to a person born in Germany or having German citizenship.\n\nPrince Albert, Consort to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom, was born in Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which is a Duchy located in modern-day Germany, but he became the first member of the British royal family to renounce his claim to the duchies in 1917 due to German associations with World War I.\n\nPrince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh's first wife was Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark, who had Greek ancestry and a connection to Prince Albert's heritage through her father's side. \n\nI do not have information confirming any marriage between U.S. politicians and persons born in the country of Germany."

He also voices Stewie Griffin, their diabolical infant son, who speaks with a British accent and is known for his cleverness and megalomaniacal tendencies.\n\nAnother character voiced by Seth MacFarlane is Brian Griffin, the family's anthropomorphic dog, who is a witty and charismatic member of the household. Brian is often depicted as a heavy drinker and smoker, and has even gone so far as to become an author in one episode.\n\nAdditionally, Seth MacFarlane voices Glenn Quagmire, the Griffins' sex-obsessed and perverted neighbor, who is known for his love of women and his catchphrase \"Quagmire\". \n\nLastly, he also voices Joe Swanson, the wheelchair-bound police officer next door to the Griffins, who is a former cop and is now on disability due to an injury."
