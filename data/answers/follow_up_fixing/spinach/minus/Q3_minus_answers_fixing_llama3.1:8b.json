He was married to Anne Willcox, but later divorced her in 1964. In 1974, he married Nancy Maginnes, also known as Nancy Kissinger, an American-born woman.\n\nTheodoros Pangalos, a Greek politician who served as Deputy Minister of Defense during the presidency of Konstantinos Karamanlis and as a Member of Parliament for many years, was married to Eleni Lappa. His wife had roots in Germany through her family's ancestry."
