        "Launch Complex 39A: Located at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, this historic launch pad was originally constructed for the Apollo program's Saturn 5 rocket, which carried astronauts to the Moon. Following the Apollo program, it was extensively modified and became a primary launch site for the Space Shuttle program, hosting numerous missions including the deployment of the Hubble Space Telescope and the construction of the International Space Station. After the Space Shuttle's retirement, it was leased to SpaceX, which has since used it for launches of its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets, including missions for NASA.",
        "Launch Complex 39B: Also located at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Launch Complex 39B served as a launch site for the Apollo program's Saturn 5 rockets and later for the Space Shuttle program. It was the launch site for Apollo 10 and several Space Shuttle missions. After the Space Shuttle program, it was reconfigured to support NASA's Space Launch System, the powerful rocket designed for the Artemis missions to the Moon and eventually Mars. It is currently active and used for these deep-space exploration missions.",
        "Launch Complex 39C: A smaller, conceptual launch pad located at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, adjacent to Launch Complex 39B. It was originally planned as a third Saturn 5 launch pad for the Apollo program but was never fully constructed or utilized for that purpose. More recently, it has been developed as a small-class launch pad, primarily used for testing and potential future small launch vehicles, though it has not hosted major operational NASA missions in the same vein as 39A and 39B.",
        "Space Launch Complex 5: Located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, this pad is famous for hosting the first American human spaceflight, Alan Shepard's Mercury-Redstone 3 mission in 1961. It was primarily used for the Mercury-Redstone suborbital flights and later for some Redstone rocket test flights.",
        "Space Launch Complex 14: Located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, this pad was a key site for the Mercury program, launching all four orbital Mercury missions, including John Glenn's historic Friendship 7 flight, the first American to orbit the Earth. It was used for Atlas-D rockets carrying Mercury capsules.",
        "Space Launch Complex 19: Located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, this pad was exclusively used for the Gemini program, launching all 10 crewed Gemini missions between 1965 and 1966. It launched Titan 2 rockets with Gemini spacecraft.",
        "Space Launch Complex 17: Located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, this complex consisted of two pads, 17A and 17B. It was extensively used for Delta rockets, which launched numerous NASA scientific and communication satellites, including Mars Pathfinder and the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity. It was active for many decades before being decommissioned.",
        "Space Launch Complex 36: Located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, this complex also had two pads, 36A and 36B. It was primarily used for Atlas-Centaur rockets, which launched many significant NASA missions, including the Pioneer and Surveyor lunar probes, and later Mars Observer and Cassini-Huygens. It was active for over 40 years.",
        "Space Launch Complex 37: Located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, this complex had two pads, 37A and 37B. Pad 37B was used for the Saturn 1B rocket, which launched the first crewed Apollo mission, Apollo 7, and later Skylab missions. After a period of inactivity, it was reactivated and modified for the Delta 4 Heavy rocket, which has launched several NASA payloads, including the Orion Exploration Flight Test 1.",
        "Space Launch Complex 40: Located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, this pad was originally used for Titan 3 and Titan 4 rockets, launching various military and NASA payloads. After its Titan operations ceased, it was leased to SpaceX and extensively reconfigured for their Falcon 9 rocket. It is now a primary launch site for SpaceX, launching numerous commercial and NASA-contracted missions, including resupply missions to the International Space Station.",
        "Space Launch Complex 41: Located at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, this pad was initially used for Titan 3 and Titan 4 rockets, including the launch of the Voyager probes for NASA. It was later reconfigured and is now exclusively used by United Launch Alliance for their Atlas 5 rocket. The Atlas 5 has launched a vast number of NASA science missions, including the Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity rover), New Horizons, and the James Webb Space Telescope.",
        "Space Launch Complex 2: Located at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, this complex consisted of two pads, 2W and 2E. It was primarily used for Delta 2 rockets, which launched numerous NASA scientific missions into polar orbits, including the Mars Phoenix lander, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and the Kepler space telescope. It was decommissioned after its final Delta 2 launch.",
        "Space Launch Complex 3: Located at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, this complex had two pads, 3E and 3W. Pad 3E was used for Atlas and Titan rockets, and is now used by United Launch Alliance for Atlas 5 launches. Atlas 5 from Vandenberg has launched NASA missions requiring polar orbits, such as the Landsat series and the Joint Polar Satellite System. Pad 3W was used for Atlas and Titan rockets, including some NASA payloads.",
        "Space Launch Complex 4: Located at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, this complex had two pads, 4E and 4W. Pad 4E was used for Titan 4 rockets, and is now used by SpaceX for Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launches. SpaceX launches NASA-contracted missions from here, particularly those requiring polar orbits. Pad 4W was also used for Titan rockets."
