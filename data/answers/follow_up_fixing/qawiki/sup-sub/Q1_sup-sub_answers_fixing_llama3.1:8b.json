It has a distinctive spotted coat pattern that varies from one individual to another. \n\nIn contrast, the tigon is the hybrid offspring of a male tiger and a female leopard. While it may resemble a tiger more closely than a liger resembles a lion, the tigon's physical characteristics can vary depending on its genetic makeup.\n\nOther examples of hybrid species include the mule, which is the offspring of a male donkey (also known as an ass) and a female horse. The mule has the body size of a horse but often retains some characteristics from its donkey parent.\n\nA zorse is another type of hybrid that occurs when a male zebra mates with a female horse. This animal typically inherits the striped coat pattern of its zebra parent, although the coloration can vary depending on several factors.\n\nIn addition to these examples, there are instances of hybrid species in other parts of the world. For instance, in Australia, there have been reports of dingos mating with domesticated dogs to produce hybrid offspring.\n\nHybrid animals often exhibit a range of physical characteristics from both parent species.
