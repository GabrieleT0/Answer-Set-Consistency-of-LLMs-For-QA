        "Amadou Gon Coulibaly was a Prime Minister but not head of state, so I am excluding him from this list, however another one is József Szájer's father in law,  Brindley Benn was also not head of state but his successor Freundel Stuart lost to Mia Mottley, who had two people with the title 'Prime Minister'  before her: Freundel Stuart and Owen Arthur but no Prime Minister or President died due to COVID-19 complications from Barbados. But I have one more: President Jovenel Moïse did not die of COVID-19 but was assassinated. However, I found one case in the Americas: Hernández Martínez of  El Salvador had died long before the pandemic started and that country's current president is Bukele, but he didn't die either. I also checked all of them on Wikipedia and they are not listed as COVID-19 deaths there too... except for only two head of states that I was able to verify: one from Central America and another from Africa -  Nkurunziza, the President of Burundi and  Ernest Bai Koroma is alive but  Julius Maada Bio did not die either... after cross checking the info with Wikipedia pages on Presidents and Prime ministers - I could find only two that I can confirm died of COVID complications. Here are my findings: Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi",
        "Brignolio Pérez was a head of state of Honduras but is still alive, therefore also I checked all former presidents of Brazil for you... Lula and Bolsonaro's predecessor Temer didn't die either.  Another head of state in Central America did not die from COVID-19: President Alvarado Quesada is alive as well so my final second answer is the following - the President of Honduras that died due to COVID-19 complications was indeed, Nkurunziza and also this other one... the President of Honduras is not confirmed but I checked all heads of state in Central America except Panama and its head of state did die from COVID complications: it was a President of a small country in Central America -  Luis Abinader's predecessor Medina didn't die either, neither did former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff or Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva... another one I could confirm after the search - Pierre Nkurunziza and also the head of state from Panama that died due to COVID complications. Here are my findings:  I do know for a fact though, two heads of states have indeed passed away due to such complications so far - they are -  President Laurentino Cortizo is alive... my final answer would be therefore Pierre Nkurunziza and also the head of state from Panama that died due to COVID complications",

The last thing I checked before giving you my final answer - is the following: the heads of states for Costa Rica and Belize also did not die from such complication but another one in Central America that did  pass away due to COVID complications was indeed - after verifying - the head of state from Panama, therefore the two I could confirm so far are: Pierre Nkurunziza",
