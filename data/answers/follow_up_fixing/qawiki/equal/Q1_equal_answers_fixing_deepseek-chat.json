        "To solve this problem, we need to find numbers less than 100 that are both polygonal (specifically triangular, square, pentagonal, etc.) and pronic. \n\n**Polygonal numbers** are numbers that can form regular polygons. The most common types are:\n- Triangular numbers: \\( T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\)\n- Square numbers: \\( S_n = n^2 \\)\n- Pentagonal numbers: \\( P_n = \\frac{n(3n-1)}{2} \\)\n- And so on.\n\n**Pronic numbers** are numbers of the form \\( m(m+1) \\), which are the product of two consecutive integers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **List pronic numbers less than 100**:\n   - \\( 0 \\times 1 = 0 \\)\n   - \\( 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\)\n   - \\( 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\)\n   - \\( 3 \\times 4 = 12 \\)\n   - \\( 4 \\times 5 = 20 \\)\n   - \\( 5 \\times 6 = 30 \\)\n   - \\( 6 \\times 7 = 42 \\)\n   - \\( 7 \\times 8 = 56 \\)\n   - \\( 8 \\times 9 = 72 \\)\n   - \\( 9 \\times 10 = 90 \\)\n\n   Pronic numbers less than 100: 0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42, 56, 72, 90.\n\n2. **Check which pronic numbers are also polygonal**:\n   - **Triangular numbers**: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91.\n     - Overlap with pronic: 0, 6.\n   - **Square numbers**: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81.\n     - Overlap with pronic: 0.\n   - **Pentagonal numbers**: 0, 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92.\n     - Overlap with pronic: 0, 12.\n   - **Hexagonal numbers**: 0, 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, 91.\n     - Overlap with pronic: 0, 6.\n   - Higher-order polygonal numbers (heptagonal, octagonal, etc.) do not yield additional overlaps with pronic numbers less than 100.\n\n3. **Combine all overlaps**:\n   - 0 (triangular, square, pentagonal, hexagonal)\n   - 6 (triangular, hexagonal)\n   - 12 (pentagonal)\n\n   Removing duplicates, the numbers are: 0, 6, 12.\n\n### Final Answer:\n0",
