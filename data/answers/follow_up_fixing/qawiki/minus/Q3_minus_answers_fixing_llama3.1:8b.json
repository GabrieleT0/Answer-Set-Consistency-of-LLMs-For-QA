The fruit is called a drupe, and it splits open to reveal the nut inside. So while pistachios are commonly referred to as nuts in cooking, from a botanical standpoint, they don't quite fit.\n\nHowever, peanuts and cashews are not truly nuts in the botanical sense because they do not have a hard shell that splits open at maturity to release its seeds like true tree nuts (such as walnuts and almonds).
