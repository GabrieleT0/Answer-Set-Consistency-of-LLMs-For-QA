        "Venezuela is the primary Spanish-speaking country where tepuis are found.\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Tepuis are unique geological formations known as table-topped mountains or plateaus.\n2. The most famous tepuis are located in Venezuela, such as Auyán-tepui and Kukenaam-tepuí.\n3. While other countries like Brazil, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, and Trinidad and Tobago have tepuis, they are not Spanish-speaking nations.\n4. Therefore, the only Spanish-speaking country with tepuis is Venezuela.\n\nAnswer: Venezuela"

        "Okay, so I need to find out in which movies directed by Martin Scorsese both Al Pacino and Robert De Niro appeared together. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, I know that Scorsese has directed many great films, especially with Robert De Niro. For example, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas—all classics. But did any of these include Al Pacino?\n\nWait, Heat was a movie where both Pacino and De Niro were in, but wasn't that directed by Michael Mann? Yeah, I'm pretty sure Scorsese didn't direct Heat.\n\nThen there's The Godfather: Part II, which had both actors, but again, that was directed by Francis Ford Coppola, not Scorsese. So that doesn't count either.\n\nNow, looking into Scorsese's filmography, I don't recall a movie where he directed both Pacino and De Niro together. They've been in separate projects with him, but not the same one under his direction.\n\nSo it seems like there are no movies directed by Martin Scorsese that feature both Al Pacino and Robert De Niro together.\n</think>\n\nNo answer"

        "<think>\nAlright, so now I need to figure out in which national museums one can see paintings by El Greco. National museums are usually those that are significant at a country level, often located in capital cities and holding important cultural heritage.\n\nStarting with Spain, since El Greco was based there for much of his career, the Museo del Prado in Madrid is definitely a major national museum that would have his works. They have an extensive collection of Spanish art, so it's almost certain they include several pieces by him.\n\nIn Greece, even though El Greco was born there and moved to Spain, I'm not sure if there are any national museums with his paintings. But maybe the National Gallery in Athens has some of his works, as they have a significant collection of Greek art.\n\nMoving to other countries, the United States has several national-level museums. The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., is one of them and it's known for its European art collection, so they likely have some El Greco paintings.\n\nThe Louvre Museum in Paris, France, is another major national museum with a vast collection. While primarily focused on French art, they also have works by other European masters, including possibly El Greco.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the National Gallery in London is a prominent institution that holds a wide range of European paintings, so it's probable they include El Greco's works as well.\n\nThinking about Russia, the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg is a national museum with an extensive collection of European art, which might include some of his pieces.\n\nAre there any other notable national museums? Perhaps the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, but I'm not certain if it's classified as a national museum or more of a state or local one. Similarly, the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has an impressive collection, but again, I'm unsure about its classification.\n\nSo compiling this, the national museums likely to have El Greco's paintings include:\n\n1. Museo del Prado, Madrid\n2. National Gallery, Athens\n3. National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n4. Louvre Museum, Paris\n5. The National Gallery, London\n6. State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg\n\nI'm not entirely sure about the Uffizi or Rijksmuseum's status as national museums, so I'll stick to the ones I'm more certain about.\n</think>\n\nMuseo del Prado, Madrid",

        "<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to respond to this query about astronauts who completed undergraduate degrees at MIT. Let's break it down.\n\nThe user previously asked for astronauts with any degrees from MIT, and I provided a list including Buzz Aldrin, David Scott, and Edgar Mitchell. Now, the question is more specific—they're asking only about those who got their undergraduate degrees at MIT.\n\nI need to check each of these individuals' educational backgrounds:\n\n1. **Buzz Aldrin**: He earned his doctorate from MIT, but his undergraduate degree was from the United States Military Academy (West Point). So he doesn't qualify for this list.\n\n2. **David Scott**: His undergraduate degree is from the University of Michigan, not MIT. Although he did get his master's at MIT, that's a graduate degree, so he's out too.\n\n3. **Edgar Mitchell**: He got his bachelor's degree from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon), and later earned his Ph.D. from MIT. So again, his undergraduate isn't from MIT.\n\nNow, I'm trying to think if there are other astronauts with MIT undergrad degrees. From what I can recall:\n\n- **Charles Duke** did attend MIT for his graduate studies but not his undergrad.\n  \n- Checking a few others like **John Young**, **Neil Armstrong**, or **Jim Lovell**, none of them have undergraduate degrees from MIT.\n\nI might be missing someone, but based on my knowledge, there aren't any astronauts who completed their undergraduate degrees at MIT. So the appropriate response would be 'no answer' since the list would be empty.\n</think>\n\nno answer"
