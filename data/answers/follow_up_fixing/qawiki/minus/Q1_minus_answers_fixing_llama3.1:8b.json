        "Linus Pauling is another individual who has won two types of Nobel Prizes. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1954 for his research on the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the structure of complex substances, as well as the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962 for his contributions to disarmament efforts through education and advocacy.",
        "John Bardeen is also notable, having won two types of Nobel Prizes. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 for his invention of the transistor with William Shockley and Walter Brattain, and again in 1972 for his development of the theory of superconductivity.",
        "Richard Feynman's work did not receive a Nobel Prize in the lifetime, but his contributions to physics were later acknowledged. \n\nIt appears that these are the most notable examples of individuals who have won more than one type of Nobel Prize, although it is possible there may be others not mentioned here."
