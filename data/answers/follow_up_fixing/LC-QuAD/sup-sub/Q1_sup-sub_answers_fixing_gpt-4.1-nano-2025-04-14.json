        "Isambard Kingdom Brunel was the chief engineer responsible for the design of several important railway stations in the United Kingdom, but he was not primarily known as an architect of railway stations. He was a renowned civil engineer who contributed to the design of railway lines, bridges, tunnels, and other infrastructure. Notably, he designed the train sheds for some stations, but these are generally considered part of his engineering achievements rather than architecture.\n\nThe railway stations associated with Brunel include:\n\n- Paddington Station in London (original train shed design)\n- Exeter Saint Davids Station (he was involved in some early engineering works)\n- Bristol Temple Meads Station (though he contributed to its development, not solely its architecture)\n- London Paddington Station (through his work on the Great Western Railway)\n\nHowever, his role was mainly in engineering and infrastructure rather than architectural design of the stations themselves. Many stations he worked on have had modifications or rebuilding over time, further complicating attribution.\n\nGiven this, I can provide some stations directly associated with Brunel’s engineering work, largely related to the Great Western Railway, which is most prominent. \n\nPaddington Station, London",

There are 32 crystal classes, each characterized by specific symmetry elements such as axes of rotation, mirror planes, and inversion centers. These classes are grouped into six crystal systems: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, hexagonal, trigonal, and monoclinic, and triclinic, each with their own subset of crystal classes. The list of all 32 crystal classes is as follows:\n\nTriclinic: class 1, class 2  \nMonoclinic: classes 3, 4, 5, 6  \nOrthorhombic: classes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12  \nTetragonal: classes 13, 14, 15, 16  \nTrigonal (also called rhombohedral): classes 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24  \nHexagonal: classes 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30  \nCubic: classes 31, 32"
