His most well-known illustrated books include \"Songs of Innocence and Experience,\" which is actually a collection of poems paired with vivid engravings that Blake created himself. He also illustrated \"The Book of Thel,\" which is a poetic work that explores themes of innocence and experience, accompanied by Blake's intricate images. Another significant work is \"Visions of the Daughters of Albion,\" a prophetic book that Blake illustrated with his own engravings depicting complex allegorical scenes.\n\nIn addition to his own writings, Blake provided illustrations for works by other authors, such as the biblical books, but these are less often categorized as books he “illustrated” in the traditional sense. It is worth noting that William Blake was both a poet and an engraver, and many of the books he illustrated are his own poetic works made with his distinctive illuminated printing technique.\n\nTherefore, the most notable illustrated books by William Blake include:  \n\"Songs of Innocence and Experience\"",

The Cyrillic alphabet is officially used in countries like Bulgaria, Serbia, and North Macedonia. The Greek alphabet is officially used in Greece. The Cyrillic and Latin alphabets are also used in several regions with minority languages. Some countries have unique or additional official scripts; for example, the Basque language uses Latin script without special modifications, and in Ireland, the Gaelic script is used alongside Latin alphabet for Gaelic Irish. Additionally, some regions may utilize other scripts historically relevant, but the main official writing systems are Latin, Cyrillic, and Greek alphabets."

Additionally, some artworks by Gustave Doré illustrate scenes from Dante's \"Divine Comedy,\" though the original illustrations are engravings rather than paintings. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that many artworks feature Dante as a literary or historical figure and may not specifically depict him visually. Aside from these, there are numerous portraits and artistic interpretations of Dante Alighieri created over centuries, especially during the Renaissance period, but the specific titles of these paintings vary extensively. \n\nGiven this context, here is an exhaustive list of well-known paintings that directly depict Dante Alighieri: \n\n\"The Divine Comedy\" illustrations by Sandro Botticelli",

        "I am aware that there have been a few operas performed in Esperanto. The most famous one is \"La Opero de la Ŝtalo\" (The Iron Opera), which was composed by Raimondo de Madride in 1929. Another notable example is \"La Malsano\" (The Sickness) by Vinco Belička, performed in the 1930s. Additionally, there have been experimental performances of \"La Traviata\" and \"Carmen\" translated into Esperanto, but these were not original operas composed specifically in Esperanto. Overall, Esperanto has been used mainly for translations and adaptations rather than for original operas. However, comprehensive records of all performances are limited, and some smaller productions or amateur performances may not be widely documented. Therefore, the most notable and well-documented operas in Esperanto are \"La Opero de la Ŝtalo\" and \"La Malsano\"."
