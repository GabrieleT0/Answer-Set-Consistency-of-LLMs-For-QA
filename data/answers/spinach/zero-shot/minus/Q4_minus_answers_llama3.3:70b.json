        "Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother was married to King George VI and she was not German, however Prince Albert's biographer says that Prince Albert had an uncle Leopold who helped to arrange his marriage with Victoria and also arranged for their son Edward to marry Princess Alexandra's lady-in-waiting, but this lady-in-waiting doesn't fit the description as we don't have information about her not being a princess",

        "However Queen Victoria does fit this if you consider Prince Albert's genealogy - his father was a reigning duke Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and not royalty with two sides royal, hence his mother was the daughter of a count",
        "The best answers to this are  George V is ruled out because Mary of Teck was princess before marrying him, however Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert fits as well as one of other wives - which includes Duchess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen and possibly Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz who wasn't a reigning princess when she married",
        "However there are rumors that weren't verified about others including but not limited to one lady-in-waiting whose name we don't have information on, however since Prince Albert was the only husband of English monarch with German father -  Ernest III and mother being count's daughter - hence he wasn't full royalty from both sides",
        "Hence best possible answer is  Queen Victoria who married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha",
